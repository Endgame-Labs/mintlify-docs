## Recommendations for Consolidation

### 1. Bundle Related Features
Instead of 13 citation entries, have one major announcement:
- "Complete Citation System Launch: Real-time inline citations, source panel, and full transparency for all AI responses"

### 2. Use Feature Milestones
For Slack integration (15+ entries), use milestones:
- "Slack Integration Phase 1: Data sync and analysis"
- "Slack Integration Phase 2: Interactive bot and rich formatting"
- "Slack Integration Complete: Full bi-directional integration"

### 3. Remove Pure Duplicates
Some entries are nearly identical:
- "Enhanced Person Insights" appears with slight variations 10+ times
- "Improved Meeting Visibility" appears 3 times in different months

### 4. Group Bug Fixes
Many "improved" entries are actually bug fixes that could be bundled:
- "Citation display fixes"
- "Scrolling behavior fixes"
- "Data accuracy improvements"

### 5. Focus on User Impact
Instead of technical descriptions, focus on what users can now do:
- ‚ùå "Enhanced AI claim validation with improved corroboration"
- ‚úÖ "Every AI response now shows its sources with one-click verification"
