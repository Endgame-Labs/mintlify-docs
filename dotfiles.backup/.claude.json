Our exclusive relationships with global Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) ensure unrivaled accuracy, currency, and trust. \n- Accuris embeds technical content directly into daily workflows with integrations to PLM, ERP, and engineering design tools \n- Accuris links authoritative standards directly to product requirements, ensuring full traceability from concept through design, testing, and compliance. \n- Accuris centralizes critical knowledge assets into one accessible environment, dramatically improving enterprise knowledge management, by powering contextual search, technical research, and decision support, enabling faster problem-solving and smarter innovation. \n- Accuris helps engineering and supply chain teams select preferred parts, avoid obsolescence, reduce sourcing risks, and lower lifecycle costs. \n- Accuris delivers the leading parts and logistics database for defense, aerospace, and heavy industry, empowering teams with real-time sourcing, pricing, and compliance data.

Accuris helps them realize they actually have a systemic traceability, risk exposure, and inefficiency problem that directly threatens revenue, regulatory standing, and mission success.\n\n### Quantify unseen impacts\n- Use metrics (like debooks, sourcing delays, rework costs) to make hidden problems visible and urgent, moving the conversation from features to business outcomes.\n\n### Connect value to strategic initiatives\n- Tie Accuris to larger customer imperatives like Digital Engineering adoption, Digital Thread enablement, audit readiness, faster time-to-field, and supply chain resilience.\n\n## Guidelines\n- Incorporate the key principles of insights selling into the output of relevant sections so that the content helps achieve any or all of the key principles.\n</sales framework>\n\n\n**User question**\n"

When starting a Claude session with `tutu start`, it will:\n\n1. Prompt you to select an active TutuItem to work on\n2. Inject context about the item and its steps into the Claude session\n3. Provide Claude with instructions on how to track progress using Tutu commands\n\n## Database\n\nTutu uses SQLite to store items and steps locally. The database is created automatically on first use.\n</README>\n",

Frontend Click Handler (TimelineContent.tsx):\n    - When a user clicks a moment row, handleRowClick is triggered\n    - It calls createThread with:\n        - The account ID\n      - First message (moment's topic/summary)\n      - Extra context containing detailed moment information\n      - Title (topic/summary)\n  2. Thread Creation Data:\n  The extraContext includes:\n  {\n    message: `New thread created from timeline moment:\n      Topic: ${moment.topic}\n      Summary: ${moment.summary}\n      Type: ${moment.moment_type}\n      Date: ${moment.start_date} to ${moment.end_date}\n      Significance: ${moment.significance}\n      Source events: ${JSON.stringify(moment.source_events)}`\n    entities: []\n  }\n  3. Backend Processing:\n    - The thread is created with this context stored at the thread level\n    - When the AI agent processes messages in this thread, it sees:\n    <additional_context>\n  New thread created from timeline moment:\n  [moment details...]\n  </additional_context>\n    - This context is included in the agent's system prompt, helping it understand what the user clicked on\n  4. Focus Mechanism:\n  The backend \"understands\" what to focus on through:\n    - The extra_context.message that describes the clicked moment\n    - The first_message containing the moment's topic/summary\n    - The account ID linking to the specific account context\n    - Source events data showing what intelligence led to this moment\n\n  This design ensures the AI assistant has full context about the specific moment the user clicked, enabling it to provide relevant insights about that particular event or topic.\n"

This is a task management system designed to work seamlessly with Claude Code.\n\n## For Claude Code Users >\u0016\n\nWhen you're working on a TutuItem through Claude Code, here are the commands you can use:\n\n### Managing Steps\n\nTo add a new step to the current TutuItem:\n```bash\ntutu add-step <item_id> \"Description of the step\"\n```\n\nTo mark a step as complete:\n```bash\ntutu complete-step <step_id>\n```\n\n### Completing the Task\n\nWhen you've finished working on the TutuItem:\n```bash\ntutu done <item_id>\n```\n\n### Checking Status\n\nTo see the current status of the TutuItem:\n```bash\ntutu status <item_id>\n```\n\n## Important Notes for Claude Code =�\n\n1. **Always track your progress** by adding steps as you work\n2. **Mark steps as complete** when you finish them\n3. **Use `tutu done`** only when the entire task is complete\n4. The item ID and step IDs are shown in the initial context when the session starts\n5. **Make sure all of your internal Todo list steps also update TutuItem and TutuItemStep**\n\n## Example Workflow =�\n\n1. You'll see the TutuItem details when the session starts\n2. As you work, add steps: `tutu add-step 1 \"Implemented user authentication\"`\n3. Complete steps as you go: `tutu complete-step 1`\n4. When everything is done: `tutu done 1`\n\nRemember: Good task tracking helps everyone understand the progress! =�",
