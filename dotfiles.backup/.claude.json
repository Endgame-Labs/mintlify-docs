It integrates seamlessly with Claude Code to provide persistent task tracking across sessions.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Install using pip or uv\nuv pip install -e .\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### Managing Items\n\nCreate a new item:\n```bash\ntutu add\n```\nThis will start an interactive session prompting for title, description, and context.\n\nList all items:\n```bash\ntutu list\n```\n\nView item details:\n```bash\ntutu status <item_id>\n```\n\nMark an item as complete:\n```bash\ntutu done <item_id>\n```\n\nEdit an existing item:\n```bash\ntutu edit <item_id>\n```\nThis will start an interactive session to update the title, description, and context.\n\nStart a Claude Code session with item context:\n```bash\ntutu start <item_id>\n```\n\n### Managing Steps\n\nAdd a step to an item:\n```bash\n# Interactive mode (prompts for multi-line description)\ntutu add-step <item_id>\n\n# Or with --description option\ntutu add-step <item_id> --description \"Description of the step\"\n```\n\nComplete a step:\n```bash\ntutu complete-step <step_id>\n```\n\n## Claude Code Integration\n\nTutu is designed to work with Claude Code. When starting a Claude session with `tutu start`, it will:\n\n1. Prompt you to select an active TutuItem to work on\n2. Inject context about the item and its steps into the Claude session\n3. Provide Claude with instructions on how to track progress using Tutu commands\n\n## Database\n\nTutu uses SQLite to store items and steps locally. The database is created automatically on first use.\n</README>\n\n---\n# Tutu Context for Claude Code\n\nThis file contains the context that gets injected when starting a Claude Code session via `tutu start`.\n\n## Working with TutuItems\n\nWhen you're working on a TutuItem through Claude Code, here are the commands you can use:\n\n### Managing Steps\n\nTo add a new step to the current TutuItem:\n```bash\n# Interactive mode (prompts for multi-line description)\ntutu add-step <item_id>\n\n# Or with --description option\ntutu add-step <item_id> --description \"Description of the step\"\n```\n\nTo mark a step as complete:\n```bash\ntutu complete-step <step_id>\n```\n\n### Completing the Task\n\nWhen you've finished working on the TutuItem:\n```bash\ntutu done <item_id>\n```\n\n### Checking Status\n\nTo see the current status of the TutuItem:\n```bash\ntutu status <item_id>\n```\n\n### Other Useful Commands\n\nList all pending items:\n```bash\ntutu list\n```\n\nEdit the current TutuItem (title, description, context):\n```bash\ntutu edit <item_id>\n```\n\n## Important Instructions for Claude Code\n\n1. **Always track your progress** by adding steps as you work\n2. **Mark steps as complete** when you finish them. Print the name of the step you completed, plus a checkmark emoji.\n3. **Use `tutu done`** only when the entire task is complete\n4. The item ID and step IDs are shown in the initial context when the session starts\n5. **Make sure all of your internal Todo list steps also update TutuItem and TutuItemStep**\n6. **Tutu location**: The absolute path to tutu is `/Users/dorkitude/Library/Python/3.11/bin/tutu`\n7. **Print steps after updates**: Always run `tutu status <item_id>` after adding or completing steps to show the current progress\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n1. You'll see the TutuItem details when the session starts\n2. As you work, add steps: `tutu add-step 1 --description \"Implemented user authentication\"`\n3. Complete steps as you go: `tutu complete-step 1`\n4. When everything is done: `tutu done 1`\n\n## Integration with Claude's Todo System\n\nRemember that when using Claude Code's built-in Todo system, you should mirror those todos as TutuItem steps. This ensures that progress is tracked both in Claude's session and in the persistent Tutu database.\n",

It integrates seamlessly with Claude Code to provide persistent task tracking across sessions.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Install using pip or uv\nuv pip install -e .\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### Managing Items\n\nCreate a new item:\n```bash\ntutu add \"Description of the task\"\n```\n\nList all items:\n```bash\ntutu list\n```\n\nView item details:\n```bash\ntutu status <item_id>\n```\n\nMark an item as complete:\n```bash\ntutu done <item_id>\n```\n\n### Managing Steps\n\nAdd a step to an item:\n```bash\ntutu add-step <item_id> \"Description of the step\"\n```\n\nComplete a step:\n```bash\ntutu complete-step <step_id>\n```\n\n## Claude Code Integration\n\nTutu is designed to work with Claude Code. When starting a Claude session with `tutu start`, it will:\n\n1. Prompt you to select an active TutuItem to work on\n2. Inject context about the item and its steps into the Claude session\n3. Provide Claude with instructions on how to track progress using Tutu commands\n\n## Database\n\nTutu uses SQLite to store items and steps locally. The database is created automatically on first use.\n</README>\n\n---\n# Tutu Context for Claude Code\n\nThis file contains the context that gets injected when starting a Claude Code session via `tutu start`.\n\n## Working with TutuItems\n\nWhen you're working on a TutuItem through Claude Code, here are the commands you can use:\n\n### Managing Steps\n\nTo add a new step to the current TutuItem:\n```bash\ntutu add-step <item_id> \"Description of the step\"\n```\n\nTo mark a step as complete:\n```bash\ntutu complete-step <step_id>\n```\n\n### Completing the Task\n\nWhen you've finished working on the TutuItem:\n```bash\ntutu done <item_id>\n```\n\n### Checking Status\n\nTo see the current status of the TutuItem:\n```bash\ntutu status <item_id>\n```\n\n## Important Instructions for Claude Code\n\n1. **Always track your progress** by adding steps as you work\n2. **Mark steps as complete** when you finish them. Print the name of the step you completed, plus a checkmark emoji.\n3. **Use `tutu done`** only when the entire task is complete\n4. The item ID and step IDs are shown in the initial context when the session starts\n5. **Make sure all of your internal Todo list steps also update TutuItem and TutuItemStep**\n6. **Tutu location**: The absolute path to tutu is `/Users/dorkitude/Library/Python/3.11/bin/tutu`\n7. **Print steps after updates**: Always run `tutu status <item_id>` after adding or completing steps to show the current progress\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n1. You'll see the TutuItem details when the session starts\n2. As you work, add steps: `tutu add-step 1 \"Implemented user authentication\"`\n3. Complete steps as you go: `tutu complete-step 1`\n4. When everything is done: `tutu done 1`\n\n## Integration with Claude's Todo System\n\nRemember that when using Claude Code's built-in Todo system, you should mirror those todos as TutuItem steps. This ensures that progress is tracked both in Claude's session and in the persistent Tutu database.\n",

It'll need to prompt claude code really well, and i need your help writing that prompt.  the technical inspiration for Prosaic is somewhat the paper:   https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13773\n\nfirst, claude code examines the file and figures out a good JSON schema for it.  row-by-row, yes, but possibly also aggregations, and almost certainly joins:  if there's a chance the file is tied to other input files (e.g. to join against).   once the parser has a good guess at a JSON schema for the document type, it then sets about creating a python parser (much like the ones we've manually made here) to extract the relevant info form the doc, and output a JSON file where each object matches the schema.  that parser needs to be saved in prosaic/parsers folder.\n\nProsaic then calls ProsaicEngine.parse(input_filename, parser, output_filename) and things proceed as normal.",

          "display": "# Update Changelog Command\n\nYou are tasked with updating the changelog files for the Flagger game project. Follow these instructions precisely.\n\n## Files to Update\n\n1. **JSON file**: `/Users/dorkitude/a/dev/flagger/public/changelog.json`\n2. **HTML file**: `/Users/dorkitude/a/dev/flagger/public/changelog.html`\n\n## Process\n\n1. First, check the current state of the changelog.json to see the last recorded commit\n2. Use `git log` to find all new commits since the last entry in the changelog\n3. Update both files with the new commits\n\n## JSON Format\n\nThe changelog.json file has this structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"entries\": [\n    {\n      \"commitId\": \"dd96050b3833eaa38545360f12a72c1884540a17\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2025-07-02 07:32\",\n      \"category\": \"improvement\",\n      \"title\": \"Refactor enemy AI to use shared BaseEnemyAI class\",\n      \"emoji\": \"♻️\",\n      \"visible\": false,\n      \"details\": [\n        \"Consolidated enemy AI logic into a reusable BaseEnemyAI class\",\n        \"Reduced code duplication across enemy soldier types\",\n        \"Fixed one bug with enemy AI pathfinding;  more to fix though.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"categories\": {\n    \"feature\": {\n      \"name\": \"New Feature\",\n      \"color\": \"var(--green)\"\n    },\n    \"fix\": {\n      \"name\": \"Bug Fix\",\n      \"color\": \"var(--red)\"\n    },\n    \"improvement\": {\n      \"name\": \"Gameplay\",\n      \"color\": \"var(--blue)\"\n    },\n    \"visual\": {\n      \"name\": \"Visual Update\",\n      \"color\": \"var(--pink)\"\n    },\n    \"audio\": {\n      \"name\": \"Audio\",\n      \"color\": \"var(--peach)\"\n    },\n    \"balance\": {\n      \"name\": \"Balance\",\n      \"color\": \"var(--yellow)\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEach entry must have:\n- `commitId`: Full commit hash\n- `timestamp`: Date and time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format\n- `category`: One of: feature, fix, improvement, visual, audio, balance\n- `title`: Commit message without emoji (extract main message)\n- `emoji`: The emoji from the commit message (if any)\n- `visible`: true if affects gameplay, false if internal/development change\n- `details`: Array of 2-3 bullet points describing the change\n\n## Category Guidelines\n\nChoose the appropriate category based on the commit:\n- `feature`: New gameplay features, weapons, enemies, mechanics\n- `fix`: Bug fixes, crash fixes, error corrections\n- `improvement`: Code refactoring, optimizations, internal improvements\n- `visual`: UI changes, visual effects, graphics updates\n- `audio`: Sound effects, music, audio system changes\n- `balance`: Gameplay balance, difficulty adjustments, stat tweaks\n\n## HTML Format\n\nThe changelog.html displays entries from the JSON file dynamically. No manual HTML editing is required - the HTML file reads and renders the JSON data.\n\n## Steps to Execute\n\n1. Read the current changelog.json to find the most recent commit ID\n2. Run `git log --date=format:'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M' --pretty=format:\"%H|%s|%ad\" [last_commit]..HEAD` to get new commits\n3. For each new commit:\n   - Extract the emoji (if present) from the message\n   - Determine the appropriate category\n   - Create a title by removing the emoji from the message\n   - Generate 2-3 detail bullet points based on the commit message\n   - Set `visible: true` if it affects gameplay, `false` if it's internal/development\n4. Add new entries to the beginning of the entries array (newest first)\n5. Save the updated JSON file\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- Preserve all emojis in the emoji field\n- Maintain chronological order (newest first)\n- Only include commits that are NOT already in the changelog\n- Our audience is game players, so set `visible: false` for:\n  - Changelog updates\n  - Documentation changes\n  - Build/config changes\n  - Internal refactoring that doesn't affect gameplay\n- Do not modify existing entries or categories\n- The details array should explain the change in player-friendly terms",

Update both files with the new commits\n\n## JSON Format\n\nThe changelog.json file has this structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"entries\": [\n    {\n      \"commitId\": \"dd96050b3833eaa38545360f12a72c1884540a17\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2025-07-02 07:32\",\n      \"category\": \"improvement\",\n      \"title\": \"Refactor enemy AI to use shared BaseEnemyAI class\",\n      \"emoji\": \"♻️\",\n      \"visible\": false,\n      \"details\": [\n        \"Consolidated enemy AI logic into a reusable BaseEnemyAI class\",\n        \"Reduced code duplication across enemy soldier types\",\n        \"Fixed one bug with enemy AI pathfinding;  more to fix though.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"categories\": {\n    \"feature\": {\n      \"name\": \"New Feature\",\n      \"color\": \"var(--green)\"\n    },\n    \"fix\": {\n      \"name\": \"Bug Fix\",\n      \"color\": \"var(--red)\"\n    },\n    \"improvement\": {\n      \"name\": \"Gameplay\",\n      \"color\": \"var(--blue)\"\n    },\n    \"visual\": {\n      \"name\": \"Visual Update\",\n      \"color\": \"var(--pink)\"\n    },\n    \"audio\": {\n      \"name\": \"Audio\",\n      \"color\": \"var(--peach)\"\n    },\n    \"balance\": {\n      \"name\": \"Balance\",\n      \"color\": \"var(--yellow)\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEach entry must have:\n- `commitId`: Full commit hash\n- `timestamp`: Date and time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format\n- `category`: One of: feature, fix, improvement, visual, audio, balance\n- `title`: Commit message without emoji (extract main message)\n- `emoji`: The emoji from the commit message (if any)\n- `visible`: true if affects gameplay, false if internal/development change\n- `details`: Array of 2-3 bullet points describing the change\n\n## Category Guidelines\n\nChoose the appropriate category based on the commit:\n- `feature`: New gameplay features, weapons, enemies, mechanics\n- `fix`: Bug fixes, crash fixes, error corrections\n- `improvement`: Code refactoring, optimizations, internal improvements\n- `visual`: UI changes, visual effects, graphics updates\n- `audio`: Sound effects, music, audio system changes\n- `balance`: Gameplay balance, difficulty adjustments, stat tweaks\n\n## HTML Format\n\nThe changelog.html displays entries from the JSON file dynamically. No manual HTML editing is required - the HTML file reads and renders the JSON data.\n\n## Steps to Execute\n\n1. Read the current changelog.json to find the most recent commit ID\n2. Run `git log --date=format:'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M' --pretty=format:\"%H|%s|%ad\" [last_commit]..HEAD` to get new commits\n3. For each new commit:\n   - Extract the emoji (if present) from the message\n   - Determine the appropriate category\n   - Create a title by removing the emoji from the message\n   - Generate 2-3 detail bullet points based on the commit message\n   - Set `visible: true` if it affects gameplay, `false` if it's internal/development\n4. Add new entries to the beginning of the entries array (newest first)\n5. Save the updated JSON file\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- Preserve all emojis in the emoji field\n- Maintain chronological order (newest first)\n- Only include commits that are NOT already in the changelog\n- Our audience is game players, so set `visible: false` for:\n  - Changelog updates\n  - Documentation changes\n  - Build/config changes\n  - Internal refactoring that doesn't affect gameplay\n- Do not modify existing entries or categories\n- The details array should explain the change in player-friendly terms",

          "display": "# Update Changelog Command\n\nYou are tasked with updating the changelog files for the Flagger game project. Follow these instructions precisely.\n\n## Files to Update\n\n1. **JSON file**: `/Users/dorkitude/a/dev/flagger/public/changelog.json`\n2. **HTML file**: `/Users/dorkitude/a/dev/flagger/public/changelog.html` (DO NOT MODIFY - it dynamically loads from JSON)\n\n## Process\n\n1. First, check the current state of the changelog.json to see the last recorded commit\n2. Use `git log` to find all new commits since the last entry in the changelog\n3. Update ONLY the JSON file with the new commits (the HTML loads data dynamically)\n\n## JSON Format\n\nThe changelog.json file has this structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"entries\": [\n    {\n      \"commitId\": \"633c1d71c536ffaf6d23fabb07f46aa81b57b5af\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2025-06-29 10:00\",\n      \"category\": \"audio\",\n      \"title\": \"Add new sound effects and changelog link\",\n      \"emoji\": \"🎵\",\n      \"details\": [\n        \"Added laser and shield guard sound effects\",\n        \"Integrated changelog viewer in game interface\",\n        \"Enhanced audio feedback for combat actions\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"categories\": {\n    \"feature\": { \"name\": \"New Feature\", \"color\": \"var(--green)\" },\n    \"fix\": { \"name\": \"Bug Fix\", \"color\": \"var(--red)\" },\n    \"improvement\": { \"name\": \"Gameplay\", \"color\": \"var(--blue)\" },\n    \"visual\": { \"name\": \"Visual Update\", \"color\": \"var(--pink)\" },\n    \"audio\": { \"name\": \"Audio\", \"color\": \"var(--peach)\" },\n    \"balance\": { \"name\": \"Balance\", \"color\": \"var(--yellow)\" }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEach entry must have:\n- `commitId`: Full commit hash\n- `timestamp`: Date and time in \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\" format\n- `category`: One of: feature, fix, improvement, visual, audio, balance\n- `title`: Commit message without emoji (extract main message)\n- `emoji`: The emoji from the commit message\n- `details`: Array of 2-3 bullet points describing the changes\n\n## Category Mapping\n\nMap commit messages to categories based on emoji and content:\n- 🆕, ✨, 🎮 → \"feature\"\n- 🐛, 🔧, 🩹 → \"fix\"\n- ⚡, 🎯, 🚀 → \"improvement\"\n- 🎨, 💄, 🖼️ → \"visual\"\n- 🎵, 🔊, 🔇 → \"audio\"\n- ⚖️, 🔄, 💪 → \"balance\"\n\n## HTML File\n\nThe changelog.html file dynamically loads data from changelog.json using JavaScript. DO NOT modify this file - it automatically displays the JSON data with proper formatting.\n\n## Steps to Execute\n\n1. Read the current changelog.json to find the most recent commit ID\n2. Run `git log --pretty=format:\"%H|%s|%ad\" --date=format:\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\" [last_commit_id]..HEAD` to get new commits\n3. Parse the new commits and create entries with:\n   - Extract emoji from commit message\n   - Determine category based on emoji/content\n   - Create a descriptive title (commit message without emoji)\n   - Generate 2-3 detailed bullet points explaining the changes\n4. Add new entries to the beginning of the entries array (newest first)\n5. Save the updated JSON file\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- Preserve all emojis in the emoji field\n- The HTML file loads dynamically - never modify it\n- Maintain chronological order (newest first)\n- Only include commits that are NOT already in the changelog\n- Do not modify existing entries or the categories object\n- Ensure proper JSON formatting",
