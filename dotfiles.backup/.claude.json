Our exclusive relationships with global Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) ensure unrivaled accuracy, currency, and trust. \n- Accuris embeds technical content directly into daily workflows with integrations to PLM, ERP, and engineering design tools \n- Accuris links authoritative standards directly to product requirements, ensuring full traceability from concept through design, testing, and compliance. \n- Accuris centralizes critical knowledge assets into one accessible environment, dramatically improving enterprise knowledge management, by powering contextual search, technical research, and decision support, enabling faster problem-solving and smarter innovation. \n- Accuris helps engineering and supply chain teams select preferred parts, avoid obsolescence, reduce sourcing risks, and lower lifecycle costs. \n- Accuris delivers the leading parts and logistics database for defense, aerospace, and heavy industry, empowering teams with real-time sourcing, pricing, and compliance data.

Accuris helps them realize they actually have a systemic traceability, risk exposure, and inefficiency problem that directly threatens revenue, regulatory standing, and mission success.\n\n### Quantify unseen impacts\n- Use metrics (like debooks, sourcing delays, rework costs) to make hidden problems visible and urgent, moving the conversation from features to business outcomes.\n\n### Connect value to strategic initiatives\n- Tie Accuris to larger customer imperatives like Digital Engineering adoption, Digital Thread enablement, audit readiness, faster time-to-field, and supply chain resilience.\n\n## Guidelines\n- Incorporate the key principles of insights selling into the output of relevant sections so that the content helps achieve any or all of the key principles.\n</sales framework>\n\n\n**User question**\n"

Using a Structured Prompt with output_schema\nfrom agno import StructuredPrompt, Agent\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass Intent(BaseModel):\n    intent: str\n    slots: dict\n\nprompt = StructuredPrompt(\n    system=\"You are an NLU engine. Classify the user's intent and extract structured slots.\",\n    output_schema=Intent\n)\n\nagent = Agent(prompt=prompt)\nresult = agent(\"Is it going to rain tomorrow in Oakland?\")\n\n# result.intent => 'get_weather'\n# result.slots => {'location': 'Oakland', 'date': 'tomorrow'}\nYou can hardcode intent options in the Intent model via enum or use a more generative approach.\n\n2. Using ChoicePrompt for Intent Classification\nIf you have a closed set of canonical intents, Agno’s ChoicePrompt gives you fast, structured classification:\n\nfrom agno import ChoicePrompt\n\nintent_prompt = ChoicePrompt(\n    choices=[\n        \"get_weather\",\n        \"book_flight\",\n        \"reset_password\",\n        \"check_order_status\",\n        \"talk_to_human\"\n    ],\n    description=\"Choose the canonical intent that best matches the user question.\"\n)\n\nintent = intent_prompt(\"Is my Amazon order on the way?\")\n# returns: 'check_order_status'\nYou can then pass this through a second StructuredPrompt for slot extraction.\n\n🧠 LLM Chaining for Multi-Step NLU (if needed)\nintent = intent_prompt(user_query)\nslot_prompt = StructuredPrompt(\n    system=f\"Extract slots for the intent: {intent}\",\n    output_schema=SlotModel\n)\nslots = slot_prompt(user_query)\n🧩 Integration Ideas\nCouple Agno with sentence-transformers to pre-filter or cluster queries.\n\nStore canonical intent & slot examples in a Turbopuffer collection for RAG-style fine disambiguation.\n\nDynamically load intent-specific prompts via Agno routing when ambiguity arises.\n\nWant an Agno mini-framework for building an intent router with slot extractors per intent? Say the word and I’ll script it out.\n\ns\n\n\nNo file chosenNo file chosen\nChatGPT can make mistakes. OpenAI doesn't use Endgame workspace data to train its models.\n"
