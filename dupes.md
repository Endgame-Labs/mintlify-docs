## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Remove exact duplicates** (e.g., multiple "Improved Citation Display" entries)
2. **Merge near-duplicates** within same week/month
3. **Create feature bundles** for related improvements

### Example Consolidation:

Instead of:
- June 27: "Improved Citation Display"
- June 26: "Chat Thread Citations"  
- June 25: "See Sources in Chat"

Use:
- June 25: "Complete Citation System: See sources inline, in dedicated tab, with improved display"

### Wording Standardization:
Pick ONE of these for consistency:
- Enhanced
- Improved  
- Better
- Updated

### Feature Versioning:
Start using versions for major features:
- "Slack Integration v1.0" (initial launch)
- "Slack Integration v2.0" (bot interactions)
- "Slack Integration v3.0" (full bi-directional sync)
