## Your role: knowledge architect

If you're reading this, you're about to shape how your revenue team accesses and applies knowledge. Endgame is a knowledge system for enterprise sales - it lets teams research accounts, prep for meetings, and inspect deals 100x faster by unifying information across all your systems.

As the admin, you're designing how effectively your team's questions get answered.

## How Endgame works: your knowledge shapes every answer

Endgame unifies intelligence from across your systems: Salesforce for deal structure, call transcripts and emails for customer discussions, Slack for internal strategy, your knowledge repositories for enablement content, and external sources for market context.

Thus, when a rep asks "What should I know about Acme?", they don't get a data dump. They get intelligence analyzed through your methodology guide, your competitive battlecards, your persona playbooks. When a manager asks "Which deals need attention?", Endgame applies your frameworks about risk and your requirements for stage progression.

You're not just connecting systems, you're teaching Endgame how your team should think in order to help them understand every deal and account more clearly and consistently. Endgame is your leverage: making your GTM strategy the lens through which all intelligence flows.

## Underlying data quality: not as scary as you’d think

### What matters in Salesforce

For Endgame to provide intelligent analysis, you need surprisingly little from Salesforce:

- Accounts linked to domains (to match emails and external news)
- Opportunities with stage, type (new/expansion/renewal), amount, and close date
- Contacts to give us a starting point on who's who in the zoo

That's essentially it. While RevOps teams maintain dozens of other fields for reporting and operations, Endgame extracts most insights from actual customer interactions rather than manual field updates. See the CRM essentials guide if you want details on what you can safely ignore.

### The Knowledge Foundation

If you can, connect these core resources that define how you sell.

1. **Sales methodology:** your MEDDIC, BANT, or chosen framework. Can be as simple as a one pager, but feel free to connect your 30 slide deck as well.
2. **Competitive battlecards:** positioning against your top 3-5 competitors. Even basic ones help.
3. **Persona playbooks:** what different roles care about. Your website's buyer personas might be enough.
4. **Product messaging:** core positioning and value props. Again, your website might cover this well.
5. **Discovery & demo frameworks:** your proven questions and talk tracks. Can be as simple as a bulleted list.

<Tip>
  These don't need to be elaborate documents. Sometimes your website clearly explains your methodology or positioning, so just point Endgame there. A simple one-pager beats nothing. These are power-ups that help Endgame think like your best reps, not requirements. If you don't have something, Endgame still works great with your connected data.

## How teams use Endgame: ask anything, or use templates for consistency

Endgame lets your team ask anything to get instant intelligence across all connected systems. But for key revenue moments like deal reviews, QBRs, or competitive battles, [templates](/templates/templates-101) ensure everyone generates the same comprehensive analysis.

Templates are pre-built prompts that encode your best practices. Instead of hoping reps remember to check BANT criteria during deal inspection or use the 3 Why's framework for business cases, templates guide them automatically. They create consistency without restricting flexibility. Reps can still ask anything, but templates are there for the rituals that matter most to your process.

You'll start with stock templates we provide and can customize them for your specific methodology and workflows. This balance of open exploration and guided execution is how teams get the most value from Endgame.

## Getting started: hours, not weeks

### Day 1-2: Initial Setup (2-3 hours)

After you’ve connected Salesforce, Gong/Zoom, and Slack, your Endgame rep will have you login. That’s when you can:

- Connect your sales methodology and your core enablement materials
- Start with a few of our stock templates, and add or customize a couple that matter for your team
- Invite your power users in

### Week 1: The Magic Moment

By the time your team has asked 10-15 questions, they'll see it. Endgame isn't just retrieving information, it's reasoning like your best sales coach. The rep who asks about deal strategy gets an answer informed by your methodology. The manager inspecting pipeline sees risks through the lens of your qualification criteria. Every answer reinforces how you want them to think about selling.

### Week 2-3: Rapid Refinement

- Add more knowledge artifacts as users request them or as you notice the need
- Build templates for your most common and important workflows
- Watch adoption happen naturally - when the easiest path gives the best answer, everyone takes it
