## Authentication

While we can primarily authenticate users via Salesforce OAuth, we also allow for Google Auth if you have Google Accounts. This makes it so users without Salesforce seats can also login using Google's robust authentication framework.

Users who login using this method will also have the same Endgame experience as those who use Salesforce.

## Requesting Access

If access using Google Accounts is needed, please send a request to [support@endgame.io](mailto:support@endgame.io), along with the email addresses you're requesting for access.
