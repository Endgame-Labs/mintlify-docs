# Endgame Changelog Style Guide

## Purpose
This guide ensures consistent, clear, and user-focused changelog entries that avoid redundancy and provide maximum value to our users.

## Changelog Structure

### 1. Monthly Releases
Group updates into monthly releases to maintain regular communication while reducing redundancy:
- Publish comprehensive monthly updates
- Bundle all changes from the month
- Use clear month/year headers (e.g., "July 2025")
- Include both major features and improvements

### 2. Feature Tiers

#### Tier 1: Major Features üöÄ
**When to use:** New capabilities that fundamentally change how users work
- Brand new features that didn't exist before
- Major integration launches (e.g., "Slack Integration Launch")
- Platform-wide changes (e.g., "AI Chat Platform Launch")

**Format:**
```markdown
### üöÄ [Feature Name] v[X.0]
[One-line description of the game-changing capability]

**Key Capabilities:**
- [User benefit 1]
- [User benefit 2]
- [User benefit 3]
```

#### Tier 2: Feature Enhancements ‚ö°
**When to use:** Significant improvements to existing features
- Performance improvements >25%
- UI/UX overhauls
- Major feature additions to existing systems

**Format:**
```markdown
### ‚ö° [Feature Area] Enhancements
- **[Specific improvement]** with [user impact]
- **[Performance metric]** through [what we did]
```

#### Tier 3: Improvements & Fixes üîß
**When to use:** Bug fixes, minor improvements, polish
- Bundle these monthly or quarterly
- Don't create individual entries

**Format:**
```markdown
### üîß Platform Improvements
- Fixed [issue] in [feature area]
- Improved [aspect] for better [result]
- Enhanced [feature] stability
```

## Writing Guidelines

### 1. Focus on User Impact

‚ùå **Don't write:**
"Enhanced AI claim validation with improved corroboration algorithms"

‚úÖ **Do write:**
"Every AI response now shows its sources with one-click verification"

### 2. Consolidate Related Features

Instead of multiple entries:
- July 10: "Improved Citations for Chat Messages"
- June 30: "Real-time Citations in Chat"
- June 27: "Improved Citation Display"

Write one comprehensive entry:
```markdown
### üìö Advanced Citation System
Complete citation and source transparency for all AI responses.
- Real-time inline citations
- Dedicated Sources tab
- One-click verification
```

### 3. Use Consistent Terminology

Pick ONE term per concept:
- **Enhanced** OR **Improved** OR **Better** (not all three)
- **AI Chat** OR **Chat** OR **Conversation** (be consistent)
- **Person** OR **Contact** OR **Individual** (choose one)

### 4. Version Major Features

For significant updates to existing features:
- "Slack Integration v2.0" (not "Improved Slack Integration" repeatedly)
- "Citation System 2.0" (not multiple citation improvements)
- "Search 3.0" (not "Enhanced Search" multiple times)

## What NOT to Include

### 1. Redundant Entries
‚ùå Multiple entries saying the same thing differently
‚ùå Progressive rollout announced multiple times
‚ùå Technical iterations of the same improvement

### 2. Internal Technical Details
‚ùå "Migrated to new database architecture"
‚ùå "Refactored authentication system"
‚ùå "Updated internal APIs"

‚úÖ Only include if there's direct user impact

### 3. Minor Visual Tweaks
‚ùå "Adjusted button padding"
‚ùå "Changed font size in sidebar"
‚ùå "Updated icon color"

‚úÖ Bundle into "UI Polish" section of monthly updates

## Entry Templates

When multiple related improvements ship together:
```markdown

```

### 2. Highlight Business Value
Always connect features to business outcomes:

- "Never miss important context with..."
- "Save hours per week by..."

### 3. Use Metrics When Meaningful
- "50% faster response times"
- "10x more accurate person matching"
- "Process 5 years of historical data"

### 4. Add Context for Major Changes
For significant updates, include:
- Why the change was made
- Migration notes if applicable
- Link to detailed documentation

## Monthly Update Structure

### Standard Monthly Format
```markdown
## [Month] [Year]

<Update label="[Month] [Year] Major Features">
[New capabilities and major enhancements]
</Update>

<Update label="[Month] [Year] Performance & Reliability">
[Performance improvements, bug fixes, and platform stability]
</Update>
```

### Monthly Summary Guidelines
- Lead with the most impactful changes
- Group all related improvements together
