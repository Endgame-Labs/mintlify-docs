## Endgame Threads Now Available in Slack
Organizations can now leverage Endgame's chat capabilities directly within their Slack workspace. Once properly configured, team members without direct Endgame access can still utilize the platform's comprehensive knowledge base through Slack's familiar chat interface. Users can initiate threads that align with their channel's designated configuration whether for individual account queries or multi-account analysis, ensuring seamless access to Endgame's insights within existing workflows.

To get started with Endgame in Slack, set up your organization's [Slack integration](https://docs.endgame.io/integrations/slack) and follow these [instructions](https://docs.endgame.io/features/slack). 

Organizations who intitially integrated with Slack before Oct 10, 2025 will need to [update their connection](https://docs.endgame.io/integrations/slack#updating-an-existing-connection-to-the-new-endgame-slack-app). 

### Thread table viewer
Tables within threads can now be viewed in a dedicated table viewer. Hover over any table and click the expand icon to open an expanded view for easier reading.

## Enhanced Chat Responses with Extended Ownership
Users will now experience chat responses powered by extended ownership queries. This enhancement is particularly valuable for users who are not direct account owners, but work in sales support roles on accounts and opportunities, or who manage teams. Prompts such as "Tell me what happened on my accounts last week" will now deliver improved results based on each user's extended ownership relationships, providing more comprehensive and relevant insights across their areas of responsibility. Account list filtering will also reflect the extended ownership model.

    alt="Ownership filter"
    width="400"
    className="rounded-lg"
  />
</Frame>

This feature uses sensible defaults under the hood, but it may not work for every organization’s unique salesforce structure. If you would like to opt out of extended ownership please contact [support@endgame.io](mailto:support@endgame.io).

### Knowledge

Upload files from your computer, sync with google drive, or link to public urls to add additional, personalized context to your chat responses — think competitive battlecards, process documents, case studies, etc.

- Files uploaded/synced at the organization level will impact all chats, while those uploaded at an account level will only affect chats in that account.
- Only Admins are able to upload at the organization level; individual users can connect files at the account level.
