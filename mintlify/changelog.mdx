### Connect your Looker data to Endgame

We've added Looker to our growing list of integrations. Bring your business intelligence and analytics into Endgame to power more data informed responses. Simply connect your Looker instance through the [integrations page](https://app.endgame.io/settings/integrations), grant Endgame access to specific queries, and Endgame will ingest the query data it has access to. Once ingested, your Looker data will be available to chat responses.

### Memory management enhanced

Managing your Endgame memories is now more transparent. You can now quickly see when a chat prompt generates memories directly within the chat response. New memories are listed with a convenient link to memory management, making it simple to review or delete them as needed.

From memory management in Personalization settings, you can now jump directly to the source thread to validate each memory's context. Endgame uses these memories to provide a tailored experience based on your preferences and specifications. Check out the docs for more details on [User Preferences](https://docs.endgame.io/features/user-preferences).

### Smarter, faster chat responses

Using Endgame to its full potential just got a whole lot easier and better.

Endgame is now faster and smarter by default. We've unified our original Search and Research modes into one streamlined experience powered by the latest frontier LLMs, giving you faster, better composed responses every time. Think of it as getting the best of both worlds without having to choose. Endgame's baseline is now much more powerful, but you can still turn on Research Mode when you need that extra boost

### Train Endgame on your writing style

Now you can train Endgame to match your unique voice across all outputs including emails, messages, proposals, and more. Simply add up to 3 writing samples in Preferences, and Endgame will analyze your style to generate content that sounds authentically like you.

For example, if you add past emails, Endgame will mirror your tone, structure, and phrasing in future email drafts. The same applies to any content Endgame creates on your behalf.

Find the writing sample upload feature in [Preferences](https://app.endgame.io/settings) to get started.

### Chorus integration now available for richer meeting insights

Chorus is the latest addition to our integrations lineup. Enrich your Endgame chat responses with valuable call data from Chorus. [Setup is simple](/integrations/chorus): just add your Chorus API key in the integrations section and Endgame will start ingesting your call data. You can even use Chorus alongside other call recording services like Gong or Zoom for comprehensive conversation coverage.

### Configuring user preferences for more relevant responses

Users can now customize their Endgame chat experience through the Personalization section in [General Settings](https://app.endgame.io/settings). The Role and Custom Instructions fields allows users to provide information about their position and chat preferences to help Endgame deliver more relevant responses.

In the Role field, users can include details about their responsibilities, level within their organization's hierarchy, types of activities they engage in, and any other data relevant to their work. This context enables Endgame to provide more accurate and meaningful responses tailored to their specific needs.

The Custom Instructions field offers additional flexibility, allowing users to specify preferences such as response formatting, tone, or any other guidelines that will enhance their chat experience.

<Frame caption="User preferences">

### Greater control over Salesforce object configuration

Endgame Admins now have greater control over which [Salesforce objects](https://app.endgame.io/settings/integrations/salesforce) Endgame can access when composing chat responses. We've enhanced the user experience for selecting custom fields on Endgame required Salesforce objects and added the ability to include additional non-required objects as well.

<Frame caption="Required object configuration">
  <img
    src="./images/salesforce-integration-required-objects-12-18-25.png"
    alt="Required object configuration"
    className="rounded-lg"
  />
</Frame>

Because Endgame references only a handful of required Salesforce objects in chat by default, selectively adding more objects can make chat responses more complete and useful, ensuring Endgame includes all the Salesforce data your team finds valuable.

<Frame caption="Additonal Salesforce objects">
  <img
    src="./images/additional-salesforce-objects-12-18-25.png"

## December 15, 2025

### Upgraded CSV and Excel Document Processing

Endgame has enhanced how we handle your newly uploaded CSV and Excel knowledge documents. You can now query data from these documents more effectively, performing aggregate, comparison, and filtering operations on tabular data with greater accuracy and reliability.

For CSV and Excel knowledge documents you previously uploaded, we recommend removing and reuploading them to take advantage of this improved experience. Only newly uploaded or synced documents will have these enhanced capabilities.

Learn more about how you can enhance your Endgame experience through knowledge documents [here](https://docs.endgame.io/features/file-upload).

## December 5, 2025

### Save preferences with user memory

[User memory](https://docs.endgame.io/features/user-preferences) automatically captures and applies your preferences across all conversations. Simply chat naturally, stating preferences like "I prefer concise answers" or "My fiscal year ends January 31," and Endgame will remember and incorporate these details into future responses without you needing to repeat yourself.

Memories are detected automatically as you chat, making interactions more personalized over time. You can review all saved memories in your settings, delete any you don't want to keep, and toggle the feature on or off at any time. This means less repetition and more relevant responses over time.

### Enhanced Knowledge Management for Admins

Admin users now have comprehensive visibility into their entire team's knowledge documents with an improved knowledge view. The new interface allows you to navigate through folders and view both organization-level and account-level content in a unified view. When uploading content through the Admin knowledge view, the system automatically categorizes documents as organization or account content and intelligently detects account associations. Admins retain control of the content with the ability to edit inferred account associations manually. All existing syncing and unsyncing capabilities remain available.

### More info while you wait

When waiting for a thread to load, users will now see detailed information about how Endgame is researching and preparing their responses. The enhanced view includes sources for each research step, so users can explore the data powering their answer in real-time. Instead of staring at a loading spinner, users can now follow along with Endgame's research process, seeing which sources it's consulting and understanding how their response is being built. This transparency turns wait time into insight time.

### Google application approval

Endgame is now officially verified by Google. This verification grants the permissions required to sync entire folders of content from Google Drive to Endgame and export your thread results directly to Google Sheets and Docs with just a click.

Review our [export](https://docs.endgame.io/features/export-thread-content) and [knowledge](https://docs.endgame.io/features/file-upload#link-files-from-google-drive) features for more information.

### Endgame threads now available in slack

Organizations can now leverage Endgame's chat capabilities directly within their Slack workspace. Once properly configured, team members without direct Endgame access can still utilize the platform's comprehensive knowledge base through Slack's familiar chat interface. Users can initiate threads that align with their channel's designated configuration whether for individual account queries or multi-account analysis, ensuring seamless access to Endgame's insights within existing workflows.

<Frame caption="Endgame thread in Slack">
  <img
    src="./images/endgame-thread-in-slack-9-29-25.png"
    alt="Endgame thread in slack"
    className="rounded-lg"
  />
</Frame>

To get started with Endgame in Slack, set up your organization's [Slack integration](https://docs.endgame.io/integrations/slack) and follow these [instructions](https://docs.endgame.io/features/slack).

Organizations who intitially integrated with Slack before Oct 10, 2025 will need to [update their connection](https://docs.endgame.io/integrations/slack#updating-an-existing-connection-to-the-new-endgame-slack-app).

### Thread table viewer

Tables within threads can now be viewed in a dedicated table viewer. Hover over any table and click the expand icon to open an expanded view for easier reading.

### Enhanced chat responses with extended ownership

Users will now experience chat responses powered by extended ownership queries. This enhancement is particularly valuable for users who are not direct account owners, but work in sales support roles on accounts and opportunities, or who manage teams. Prompts such as "Tell me what happened on my accounts last week" will now deliver improved results based on each user's extended ownership relationships, providing more comprehensive and relevant insights across their areas of responsibility. Account list filtering will also reflect the extended ownership model.

<Frame caption="Ownership filter">
  <img
    src="./images/owner-filter-8-27-25.png"
    alt="Ownership filter"
    width="400"
    className="rounded-lg"
  />
</Frame>

This feature uses sensible defaults under the hood, but it may not work for every organization’s unique salesforce structure. If you would like to opt out of extended ownership please contact [support@endgame.io](mailto:support@endgame.io).

### Enhanced template management for administrators

Admin users now have access to improved template management capabilities. The enhanced interface includes search functionality, filtering options, and sorting capabilities.

### Expanded email distribution for tasks
