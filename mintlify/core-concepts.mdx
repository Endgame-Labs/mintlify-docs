## ðŸ’» How data is obtained and analyzed

### ðŸ“š Data and Sources

Endgame combines your business knowledge, particularly data contained in emails, call recordings, notes, internal conversations, and uploaded account documents with everything that is publicly available on the internet. We are currently CRM-first: we focus on the accounts in your CRM and no others, because we believe those are the ones you actually care about.

An equally important data source is contained in Endgame's Logic.

  Details of each integration can be found in the [Integrations](/integrations/salesforce) section.

## ðŸ§© Logic

Endgame researches every person and account in your book through the lens of your sales strategy and process. We do this by capturing your strategy and process, in natural language, into our rules and templates.

### Rules

Think of rules as the concepts you would onboard a new sales rep or account manager into. Are you a MEDDIC or BANT shop? What does command of the message mean for your org? Which products do you sell, how do you position them, and how do you cross-sell them? Who are your competitors and how do you differentiate?

### Templates

Certain activities within sales and account teams are driven by consistent data points. For example, you may require all active Opportunities to have MEDDPICC filled out, or you might expect every rep on your team to have an account plan with a stakeholder map, action plan, and one-page business case written for each key account. Your CRO may expect a particular format of briefing for meeting preparation. Endgame's templates allow you to define structured documents that are dynamically written using AI, informed by all data sources, so that every account has all required documents available at all times.

### **Claims**

Endgame has developed a system for showing our work. Every statement made by Endgame (i.e. when answering a Chat question from you, or making a statement in an Artifact), is run through a system that validates the statement and all the sources behind it for quality and accuracy. Our goal is to ensure all data in Endgame is easily inspectable, so you understand how we came to the conclusions we did in any given interaction.

## ðŸ’¼ Interacting with Endgame

### Chat

The simplest way to get answers from Endgame is by querying Endgame via Chat, just like how you might ask questions of ChatGPT or Perplexity. You can chat with Endgame account by account (including the stakeholders related to that account) from the [account detail page](navigating-endgame#account-detail-page).

You can also query across multiple accounts in our homepage. Here you can explore prompts that cover the entire breadth of the accounts in your organization. Ask questions that target your book of accounts, explore organizational trends, provide insights about your teamâ€™s sales strategies, and more.

### Tasks

You can now schedule daily, weekly, or monthly email digests that act in the same way as firing a prompt off in the app. Curate your tasks to keep you up to date at the start of your day or week with whatever cross account information is most helpful to you. 

### Artifacts

As noted above, templates power structured responses from Endgame's chat, such as specifically formatted account plans, meeting prep briefs, deal reviews, and more. You can publish specific threads generated through chat for the purpose of sharing them, both internally and externally. We call a published thread an Artifact, which you can learn more about [here](/features/publishing-artifacts).
