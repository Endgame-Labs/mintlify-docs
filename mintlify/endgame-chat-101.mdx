<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Ask follow-up questions" icon="question">
    Think of the thread as a journey that allows you to continue exploration based on nuggets of insight that you see or areas you want to dig deeper into.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Start with the desired output in mind" icon="lightbulb">
    Knowing what you want as the final output  helps clarify your approach to questions. Tell Endgame what that output is when you ask your questions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use multiple perspectives" icon="people">
    Use different perspectives to evaluate from angles that you're not used to as a way to uncover missing insights. For example, start a question with "as a VP sales" or "as the economic buyer" or as "the prospect's CFO".
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ask for feedback/grading" icon="pen">
    Whether you're reviewing a recent meeting, analyzing a deal, or building a proposal, asking AI to grade the object and suggest how it could be better can lead to many new insights and ideas.

  <Card title="Ask for quotes" icon="quotes">
    Asking for quotes ("include quotes") is super helpful for capturing the language of the customer and focusing in on key topics with far more precision.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ask for options" icon="list">
    There's often not a single best answer. Asking Endgame for multiple options ("give me 3 options for how toâ€¦") can yield richer surface area from which to ideate and take action.
