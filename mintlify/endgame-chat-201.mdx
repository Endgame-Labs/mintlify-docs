## Introduction

Endgame isn't just another search tool. It's your strategic thinking partner designed to help you build intuition and make better decisions about your accounts. The key to unlocking Endgame's full potential lies in how you communicate with it.

Think of Endgame like your most experienced sales colleague: the more context you provide and the more thoughtfully you frame your questions, the more valuable insights you'll receive.

## Core principles

  <Card title="Human judgment matters" icon="search-check">

## Prompting framework

Different situations call for different prompting strategies. Use this framework to choose the right approach:

  />
</Frame>

### Flexible exploration for discovery

This approach is useful early in your account research, when you're not sure what you're looking for, or when you want to uncover unexpected opportunities.

<Card>
  **Approach:** Start broad, then narrow down based on what you discover.

  **Example Pattern:**

  - **Initial**: "What expansion opportunities exist at [Company]?"
  - **Clarify**: "Tell me more about the digital transformation angle you mentioned"
  - **Refine**: "How urgent is this digital transformation for them specifically?"
</Card>

### Structured exploration for research

This approach is useful when you want to systematically explore multiple angles or need comprehensive coverage of a topic.

<Card>
  **Approach:** Use frameworks and structured questions to ensure thorough analysis.

  **Example Pattern:**

  - **Initial**: "Analyze [Company] across financial health, growth initiatives, and technology investments"
  - **Dive deeper**: "Focus on their technology investments—what patterns do you see?"
  - **Get tactical**: "Based on those patterns, what's our best entry point?"
</Card>

### Flexible outcomes for strategizing

This approach is useful when you have a specific goal but are open to various approaches to achieve it.

<Card>
  **Approach:** State your objective clearly, then let Endgame suggest multiple paths.

  **Example pattern:**

  - **Initial**: "I need to get a meeting with their CTO. What approaches could work?"
  - **Choose direction**: "I like the industry trends approach. What specific trends should I focus on?"
  - **Get tactical**: "Draft a LinkedIn message using that angle"
</Card>

### Structured outcomes for execution

This approach is useful when you know exactly what you need and want a specific deliverable.

<Card>
  **Approach:** Use the Intent → Context → Ask structure for precision.

  **Example of the framework:**

  - **Intent**: "I want to help my champion convince their CTO to pilot us"
  - **Context**: "I know we've helped our champion build a tight ROI case, but we need the CTO to get excited by tying to near-term business priorities"
  - **Ask**: "Can you write a 1-page business case that combines priorities, quotes, and ROI that my champion could email to her CTO?"
</Card>

## Advanced techniques

<Steps>
  <Step title="Building context over time">
    Each conversation builds context. Reference previous insights: "Based on what we discussed about their Q3 priorities..." or "How does this new information change our approach from earlier?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Using constraints creatively">
    "I have 5 minutes with their CEO. What's the one thing I should say?" or "Explain this technical concept to a non-technical executive"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterative refinement">
    Don't settle for the first response. Push for better with: "Make it more specific to their industry" or "Add more urgency to the messaging"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask Endgame for help">
    Tell Endgame what you're trying to achieve and give it a draft prompt, then ask Endgame what it'd recommend the prompt should be
  </Step>
</Steps>
