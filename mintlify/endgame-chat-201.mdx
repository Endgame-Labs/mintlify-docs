## Prompting framework

### Flexible Exploration - "Discovery Mode"

<Card>
  **When to use:** Early in your account research, when you're not sure what you're looking for, or when you want to uncover unexpected opportunities.

  **Approach:** Start broad, then narrow down based on what you discover.

  **Example Pattern:**

  - **Initial**: "What expansion opportunities exist at [Company]?"
  - **Clarify**: "Tell me more about the digital transformation angle you mentioned"
  - **Refine**: "How urgent is this digital transformation for them specifically?"
</Card>

### Structured Exploration - "Research Mode"

<Card>
  **When to use:** When you want to systematically explore multiple angles or need comprehensive coverage of a topic.

  **Approach:** Use frameworks and structured questions to ensure thorough analysis.

  **Example Pattern:**

  - **Initial**: "Analyze [Company] across financial health, growth initiatives, and technology investments"
  - **Dive deeper**: "Focus on their technology investments—what patterns do you see?"
  - **Get tactical**: "Based on those patterns, what's our best entry point?"
</Card>

### Flexible Outcomes - "Strategy Mode"

<Card>
  **When to use:** When you have a specific goal but are open to various approaches to achieve it.

  **Approach:** State your objective clearly, then let Endgame suggest multiple paths.

  **Example pattern:**

  - **Initial**: "I need to get a meeting with their CTO. What approaches could work?"
  - **Choose direction**: "I like the industry trends approach. What specific trends should I focus on?"
  - **Get tactical**: "Draft a LinkedIn message using that angle"
</Card>

### Structured Outcomes - "Execution Mode"

<Card>
  **When to use:** When you know exactly what you need and want a specific deliverable.

  **Approach:** Use the Intent → Context → Ask structure for precision.

  **Example of the framework:**

  - **Intent**: "I want to help my champion convince their CTO to pilot us"
  - **Context**: "I know we've helped our champion build a tight ROI case, but we need the CTO to get excited by tying to near-term business priorities"
  - **Ask**: "Can you write a 1-page business case that combines priorities, quotes, and ROI that my champion could email to her CTO?"
</Card>

## Advanced techniques

<Steps>
  <Step title="Building context over time">
    Each conversation builds context. Reference previous insights: "Based on what we discussed about their Q3 priorities..." or "How does this new information change our approach from earlier?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Using constraints creatively">
    "I have 5 minutes with their CEO. What's the one thing I should say?" or "Explain this technical concept to a non-technical executive"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterative refinement">
    Don't settle for the first response. Push for better with: "Make it more specific to their industry" or "Add more urgency to the messaging"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask Endgame for help">
    Tell Endgame what you're trying to achieve and give it a draft prompt, then ask Endgame what it'd recommend the prompt should be
  </Step>
</Steps>
