# Feature Versioning Guide for Endgame Changelog

## Purpose
This guide establishes a versioning system for major features to avoid redundant changelog entries and clearly communicate feature evolution to users.

## When to Use Feature Versions

### Version-Worthy Features
Features that warrant versioning are those that:
1. Have multiple significant iterations over time
2. Are core to the platform experience
3. Users reference by name (e.g., "Slack integration", "Citation system")
4. Undergo major overhauls or redesigns

### Examples of Versionable Features
- **Integrations**: Slack v1.0 ‚Üí v2.0 ‚Üí v3.0
- **Core Systems**: Citation System v1.0 ‚Üí v2.0
- **Major Features**: Chat Experience v1.0 ‚Üí v2.0
- **Search**: Search v1.0 ‚Üí v2.0 ‚Üí v3.0
- **AI Capabilities**: AI Engine v1.0 ‚Üí v2.0

## Version Numbering System

### Major Versions (X.0)
Increment the major version when:
- Completely new architecture or approach
- Breaking changes to existing functionality
- Major new capabilities that transform the feature
- Visual redesign that significantly changes user experience

**Example**: Slack Integration v2.0
- v1.0: Basic channel mapping and data import
- v2.0: Full bi-directional sync with AI chat in Slack

### Minor Versions (X.Y)
Increment the minor version when:
- New functionality added to existing feature
- Significant performance improvements (>25%)
- Enhanced capabilities without breaking changes
- Multiple related improvements ship together

**Example**: Citation System v1.2
- v1.0: Basic inline citations
- v1.1: Added sources panel
- v1.2: Real-time citations + enhanced formatting

### Patch Versions (X.Y.Z)
Generally not included in changelog unless critical:
- Bug fixes
- Security patches
- Minor performance improvements
- Small UI tweaks

## Versioning in Changelog Entries

```markdown
### üöÄ [Feature Name] v1.0

## Guidelines for Version Decisions

### When to Create a New Major Version

‚úÖ **Do increment major version when:**
- More than 50% of the feature is rewritten
- User workflow fundamentally changes
- Breaking API or integration changes
- Complete visual redesign
- Architecture overhaul

‚ùå **Don't increment major version for:**
- Performance improvements alone
- Bug fixes
- Minor UI updates
- Adding small features

### When to Bundle Changes

Instead of multiple small updates:
```
‚ùå June 1: "Improved Slack sync speed"
‚ùå June 5: "Added Slack threading support"  
‚ùå June 10: "Enhanced Slack notifications"
‚ùå June 15: "Better Slack error handling"
```

Bundle into one version update:
```
‚úÖ June 15: "Slack Integration v1.3"
- Faster sync speed (2x improvement)
- Full threading support
- Enhanced notifications
- Improved error handling
```

## Communication Best Practices

### 1. Announce Versions Clearly
- Always include version number in major feature updates
- Reference previous version when upgrading
- Explain what makes this a new version

### 2. Set Expectations
- For v1.0: "Initial release of [feature]"
- For v2.0: "Completely redesigned [feature]"
- For v1.x: "Enhanced [feature] with new capabilities"

### 3. Provide Migration Context
For major versions, always include:
- What's different from the previous version
- Any action users need to take
- Benefits of upgrading
- Link to migration guide if applicable

## Version Deprecation

When retiring old versions:

```markdown
### ‚ö†Ô∏è [Feature] v1.0 Deprecation Notice

**Timeline:**
- **August 1**: v2.0 becomes default for new users
- **September 1**: Migration tools available
- **October 1**: v1.0 deprecated, all users on v2.0

**Action Required:** [Specific steps users must take]
```
