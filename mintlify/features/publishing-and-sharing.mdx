## Sharing Threads

As you ask Endgame questions in Threads, you may sometimes want to share the answers you're getting with your colleagues while continuing to work in Endgame. We enable this by allowing you to share a thread.

By sharing your Thread, it will now be available as a link to non-Endgame users as well as be visible to other Endgame users in the Shared Thread tab in the Account Detail page if it is account specific. If the thread is multi-account it will be present in the [threads list](https://app.endgame.io/threads) and show a Shared label.

To share your Thread, open up a thread and click "Share" at the top right corner. Doing so will present you with a modal, asking you to confirm whether you'd like to proceed.

    className="rounded-lg"
  />
</Frame>

Once you have clicked Share in the modal, you'll see the status changed to Shared in the top right corner. Upon clicking on the Shared button at the top right of the thread, you'll see both the link to share the thread as well as a button that takes you directly to it.

The Shared button on the Thread is also where you can stop sharing, which causes the original share link to stop working, thus removing access for anyone to see that snapshot of the Thread as well as from being visible by other Endgame users in the Account Library.

<Note>
  Any changes, such as additional questions, made to a Shared Thread will be
  reflected in the thread upon a refresh, and thus visible to external viewers

## Collaborating with Threads

Sharing threads enables enhanced collaboration in two primary ways.

### External Sharing

First, a Thread that has been shared enables you to share it externally with anyone with a link. These shared threads are not editable and only show the generated title summary for each prompt within the Thread and its contents (not the initial prompts).

The Thread owner can continue to chat with the original Thread in Endgame, and additional prompts and outputs will similarly be available in the shared thread.

    alt="Shared thread"
    className="rounded-lg"
  />
</Frame>

### Internal Visibility

Second, while Threads are by default private to the user that created the Thread, once a Thread has been shared, the Thread will now be visible in the Shared Threads tab on account details pages to all Endgame users. Shared multi-account chat threads that are initiated from the homepage will be visible in the [threads list view](https://app.endgame.io/threads)

This allows any Endgame user to identify important Threads that are intended to be consumed by other internal stakeholders, whether it be to inform, coordinate or collaborate with one another.
