## What are skills

A Skill is a reusable instruction file that instructs Endgame (and the AI) how to handle a specific type of tasks. 

Think of it like your team's playbook: instead of re-explaining your process every time, you write it down once in a skill, and the AI follows it automatically whenever that skill is used.

**A Skill can define things like:**

- The goal of the task (e.g., "write a follow-up email after a discovery call")
- The format or structure the output should follow
- Your company's tone, messaging, or value props to always include
- Step-by-step instructions the AI should walk through
- Examples of emails, call scripts, or summaries that have worked well

A simple example:

Your team always follows up after a demo the same way — thank them for their time, recap the top pain points they mentioned, and end with a clear next step. Instead of coaching the AI on this every time, you create a demo-follow-up skill with those instructions baked in. Now anyone on the team gets a consistent, on-brand follow-up in seconds.

**Why use Skills?**

- Save time — stop rewriting the same prompts from scratch
- Get consistent, on-brand output across your whole team
- Onboard new reps faster by sharing proven playbooks
- Build a library of your best messaging and workflows

## Using Skills in threads

To use a skill, click on one of the skill cards under the chat input or click the More skills button below the skill cards to access your full skills library. In the skills modal you can filter and search within your skills.  

Once you click on a skill, a basic prompt will populate the chat input to trigger that skill. All you have to do then is hit Enter to have Endgame start a new thread that utilizes that skill in the response. Before you hit enter, you can also choose to directly make edits and tweaks to the prompt if needed before starting your thread.

You can view more information about the content of a skill by clicking on the info icon in the top right corner of the skill card. 

## Creating Skills

Some skills in your library will be controlled by account admins; you cannot edit or delete these. You can, however, create your own skills by clicking Add Skill within the skills modal. 

**Anatomy of a Skill:**
- Title: the title of your skill which will be displayed in the skill card
- Description: 
- Example Prompt:
- Context:

You can filter down to your personal skills using the My Skills tag in the main skill modal view or within the skill grid.
