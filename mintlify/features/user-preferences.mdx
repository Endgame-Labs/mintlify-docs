## User configuration

Users are initially prompted to enter details about their job role when first logging into Endgame. Providing context about your role, including your responsibilities, level within your organization's hierarchy, types of activities you engage in, and the data most relevant to your work, enables Endgame to deliver more accurate and meaningful responses to your prompts.

Once the initial setup is complete, users can edit their role information at any time through [User Preferences](https://docs.endgame.io/features/user-preferences).

Users can also add other useful context about themselves or how they prefer to interact with chat in the Custom Instructions input. These instructions will be used to formulate all chat responses. For example:

- "I prefer concise, direct responses without excessive explanations."
- "I work in sales and need help with objection handling and deal strategy."
- "Focus on actionable advice I can implement immediately."
- "Use conversational language and avoid overly technical jargon."
- "Provide responses with specific examples whenever possible."

## Memories
Users can add memories through their chat interactions with Endgame. Memories capture preferences and directives that enhance future chat responses. They are automatically detected and saved based on your interactions. For example, memories might include statements like "I prefer answers with tables when possible" or "My fiscal year ends January 31."

User memories are incorporated into the system that generates your responses, so you'll experience the results of your memory preferences in subsequent chats.

## How to create or update a memory

Memories are detected and saved automatically through your chat interactions. You can be explicit to ensure your preferences are captured, for example "I like my answers concise," but Endgame will also detect memories that are less directly stated. You can update a memory by including the change in a subsequent prompt, such as "I only like concise answers when drafting emails" or "I prefer verbose answers."

## Turning memories on/off

This feature is toggled on by default to capture your memories. You can update this setting in the [user personalization settings view](https://app.endgame.io/settings). When Memories is toggled on, your memories from chat are stored and used in your chat responses. When toggled off, new memories are not saved and existing memories, if any, are not used in chat responses.

## How to view and delete memories

Users can review their memories in the [user personalization settings view](https://app.endgame.io/settings/personalization). To navigate to user settings, click on your initials in the lower left sidebar and click on Manage in Memories. Here you'll see a list of the memories Endgame has saved for you along with the quote that informed the memory. You can delete any memories you don't want Endgame to use. Because memories are saved automatically, Endgame may occasionally interpret something as a memory that you don't want saved. You can easily review and delete them here.
