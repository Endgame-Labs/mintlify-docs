Endgame is transforming enterprise sales by equipping every seller with what we believe is the strongest and most durable competitive advantage: **knowledge**.

## How it works

By using AI to integrate your GTM strategy with first and third-party data sources (emails, calls, CRM, LinkedIn, news, and financial reports) and making all of the information immediately accessible and relevant through an intuitive Q&A chat interface.

This results in an intelligent, actionable source of truth for every account and person in your book of business, instantly at your fingertips.
