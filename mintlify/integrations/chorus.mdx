    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Chorus API key">
    On the integrations page, click Connect for Chorus. You will need to generate a Chorus API key for use by Endgame. Within Chorus, navigate to Settings -\> API Access -\> Generate API token. On the Chorus management page enter your new Chorus API key and click Connect. Once your key has been added, Endgame will initiate ingestion and processing of your call data. 

    <Info>
    Endgame can only ingest meeting data that the API token creator has access to. If you're not seeing the data you expect, it may be a token permissions issue. Contact us at [support@endgame.io](mailto:support@endgame.io) for additional support.
