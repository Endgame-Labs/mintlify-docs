    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Chorus API key">
    On the integrations page, click Connect for Chorus. You will need to generate a Chorus API key for use by Endgame. Within Chorus, navigate to Settings -\> API Access -\> Generate API token. On the Chorus management page enter your new Chorus API key and click Connect. Once your key has been added, Endgame will initiate ingestion and processing of your call data. TODO: It can take up to xx hours for this data to be available within the app.

    <Info>
      Endgame is limited by the creator of the API token's time with their organization. We are only able to ingest call data as far back as the user's start date with Chorus.
