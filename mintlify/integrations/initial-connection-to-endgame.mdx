Getting started with Endgame is simpleand only requires that you authenticate via Salesforce.

## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Endgame">
    Go to https://end-p1.endgame.io/
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate with Salesforce">
    Click "Continue with Salesforce"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grant API permissions">
    You'll be presented with two Salesforce API authentication screenssimply click "Allow" on both, at which point you'll be redirected back to Endgame
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect additional integrations">
    From there you can choose to authenticate:

    - [Gong](/integrations/gong) (if you're a technical admin)
    - [Zoom](/integrations/zoom) (if you're a Zoom administrator)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What happens next?

Once you have things connected, Endgame will automatically start ingesting your Salesforce data. This can take some time, and our team will reach out when it's ready.

<Info>
  Data ingestion typically takes a few hours depending on the size of your Salesforce instance. You'll receive an email notification when your data is ready.
