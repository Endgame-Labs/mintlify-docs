## What Endgame actually needs

Your CRM provides the structural foundation: who's involved in what deal at what stage. Endgame then layers on intelligence by analyzing emails, calls, and conversations. Understanding this division helps you focus on what really matters in Salesforce.

The essentials are surprisingly simple:

**For opportunities:**

- Stage (where they are in the buying process)
- Type (new business, expansion, or renewal)
- Amount and close date (for prioritization)

**For accounts and contacts:**

- Company name and domain (to match emails and external news)
- Contact names and emails

With just these basics clean, Endgame can provide intelligent analysis about deal health, stakeholder engagement, and strategic recommendations. And if there are fields you really want us to pay attention to, just [tell us](https://docs.endgame.io/integrations/salesforce#important-fields) and weâ€™ll prioritize them in our analysis.

## What you can stop stressing about (for Endgame)

RevOps teams maintain dozens of fields for good operational reasons: reporting, attribution, forecasting. But Endgame doesn't need perfect hygiene on most of them. Fields like next steps, competitor tracking, pain points, or MEDDIC scores might be important for your internal processes, but Endgame extracts these insights from actual customer interactions rather than manual field updates. Even contact roles are just a nice to have -- Endgame will deduce who it thinks your champions, buyers, and detractors are based on call and email data rather than relying on SFDC fields, providing an objective 3rd party lens that might help you re-think your accounts and deals. 

Keep maintaining whatever fields your business needs for reporting. Just know that Endgame's intelligence comes from analyzing what's actually happening in external and internal communications, not from manually updated fields.

## The bottom line

Focus on maintaining clean basics: accurate stages, contacts linked to accounts, and basic fields like amount and close date reasonably current. If you have multiple opportunities per account, add Opportunity contact roles.

Endgame extracts intelligence from actual activity rather than manual field updates. Your CRM doesn't need to be perfect, just structurally sound enough to understand who's involved in what opportunity at what stage.
