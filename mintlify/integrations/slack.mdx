Use the instructions below to enable Slack integration in Endgame. Once enabled, Endgame will ingest your Slack messages from a specific channels and associate it with a specific Accounts as well as enable Endgame threads within Slack for both account specific and multi-account Endgame chats.

<Note>
  Endgame threads within Slack are still in Beta - contact
  [support@endgame.io](mailto:support@endgame.io) to inquire about access
</Note>

## Step 1: Enable the integration

<Warning>
  Connecting to the Slack API requires that the connecting user is either a
  Slack Administrator or gets permission from one. Be sure to check with your
  organization admin before trying to connect Slack.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Configuration">
    Navigate to the [integrations page](https://end-p1.endgame.io/settings/integrations). Only Endgame Admins can configure organization integrations

    If needed, login to your Endgame account via Salesforce

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Setup">
    From the integrations page, click "Connect" to kick off the Slack authentication process.

      />
    </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Approval (if needed)">
Upon proceeding to the next page, first-time users without administrative privileges will be directed to a request approval interface. Submitting this request will prompt Slackbot to send a direct message notification to your organization's designated administrators. The requesting user will subsequently receive a Slackbot direct message confirming whether their request has been approved or denied by an administrator.

Note: If this approval page does not appear, your account has already been authorized for system access.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Grant Permissions">
    On this next page, click "Allow" to give us permissions.

        className="rounded-lg"
      />
    </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Channel Mapping">
You will be directed to a configuration page where you can designate which public Slack channel content will be associated with specific Endgame Accounts. Establishing these channel connections also enables you to initiate Endgame threads directly within the corresponding Slack channels. For comprehensive guidance on utilizing Endgame within Slack, check out our [Slack](/features/slack) documentation.

Additionally, you have the option to configure Organization-Wide Channels. While these channels do not contribute data for analytical purposes, they facilitate multi-account Endgame conversations within those specific channels.

      <img
        src="../images/slack-mapping-9-26-25.png"

        className="rounded-lg"
      />
    </Frame>

    For instance, if you have an account for a company named CompanyCo, you would select that from the Account dropdown. Then in Channels, select the channels that are associated with that Account, such as one called #deal-companyco.

    You can add multiple channels to a single Account, but only one at a time. So using the previous example, you could then also add a #companyco-help channel. Both channels would then have their messages ingested to Endgame and be associated with that single Account.

    To connect an organization-wide channel, "Select channels to ingest" and Submit.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Endgame currently cannot distinguish between different account conversations
  in a single Slack channel. Instead, use a Slack channels that are dedicated to
  sigular account conversations to enhance your Endgame data.
  <br />
  We will _only_ ingest channels that you have selected and associated with an
  Account or at the Organization level. Other than the names of public channels,
  no other data is ingested without your permission.
