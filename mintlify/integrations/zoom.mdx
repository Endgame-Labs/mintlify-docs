## Usage

That's it\! Now that you've connected Zoom to Endgame, we'll automatically ingest your data into our systems and present our insights in Endgame.

Endgame accesses meetings (both past and upcoming), their participants, and recordings.

Within Endgame, this allows us to show meetings that you've had on an account, which opportunities they're associated with, and to help build a robust picture of your interactions with customers and contacts.
