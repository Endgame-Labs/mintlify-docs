Admin users can upload knowledge documents to enhance the context provided to Endgame for all chat responses. This unified view displays all knowledge content across your entire organization, including both organization-level and account-specific documents. Organization-level content is particularly useful for materials like playbooks, case studies, sales decks, or any other resources that aren't already captured through Endgame's existing integrations. Account-specific documents can also be uploaded and managed here, ensuring comprehensive knowledge management in a single location. Helpful filters are provided for document level, entity type, and account in addition to basic search.

When uploading content through the Admin knowledge view, the system automatically categorizes documents as organization or account content and intelligently detects account associations. This can take a few minutes to run, the more files uploaded, the longer the associations take. Admins have the ability to edit account associations manually.

<Info>
  Adding an account association to an organization-level document converts it to an account specific document.
