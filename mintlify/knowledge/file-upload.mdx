Admin users have the ability to upload documents to enhance the context provided to Endgame for all chat responses. Some types of documents that could be useful are playbooks, case studies, or sales decks. Anything that isn't already captured in the mediums Endgame already ingests can be added here.

### Adding a document from your computer
Navigate to the [Knowledge](https://end-p1.endgame.io/settings/knowledge) section in settings. Click Add Files and select Upload from device.

Once authenticated, select up to 10 files at a time to sync with Endgame. You can edit the description for the files before clicking to Select Files.

### Removing files
Once your files are uploaded or linked, you can delete or unlink them anytime by clicking on the overflow menu for the item and then Delete file or Unlink file . By deleting or unlinking the file you ensure that information associated with that file will no longer be present in new chat responses.
