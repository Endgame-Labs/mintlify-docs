Your organization's Google workspace configuration may include restrictions that prevent Endgame from syncing files in your Drive. In such cases, you may experience difficulty authenticating with Google through Endgame, or you may successfully authenticate but find that no files appear as available for syncing to Endgame. We've outlined a few steps you can take at the workspace level to grant access that Endgame needs.


## Workspace Restrictions

### Apps / Google Workspace / Drive and Docs Restrictions

A Google administrator must check this box or no external Google Drive applications will work in your workspace.

### Security / API Controls / Settings Restrictions

If your workspace restricts third-party applications as shown below, you will need to either request administrator approval for Endgame or have an administrator add Endgame as an approved application in your organization's configuration.

1. In Security → API Controls → App Access Control → Configure New APP

2. Search for Endgame and Choose client id [828762795196-g4tpmtqgbeqvif542h1u5n3jkdgeo3mc.apps.googleusercontent.com](http://828762795196-g4tpmtqgbeqvif542h1u5n3jkdgeo3mc.apps.googleusercontent.com) from the list. The other Endgame app listed is not harmful, it is used for app login. It is OK to have both configured and allowed.

3. Set to Specific Google data (this does not give any more permissions than are necessary and requested). Trusted status is not required.
