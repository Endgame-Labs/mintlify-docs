### The basics

Most sales teams have dozens, sometimes hundreds, of artifacts scattered across various systems. But for Endgame to provide valuable intelligence, you really only need to [connect](/knowledge/file-upload) a handful of core documents that define how you sell. Think about the things you might train a new sales rep on in the first few weeks:

1. **Sales methodology guide**: MEDDIC, BANT, or your own custom framework; what matters is how _your team_ uses it, not just the generic description anyone can find on the web.
2. **Competitive battlecards** for your top 3-5 competitors. Basic positioning notes are fine, doesn't need to be elaborate.
3. **Persona / industry playbooks:** how to engage different stakeholders or verticals. Certain pages from your company website might be sufficient in some cases, but a few bullets on how the pitch changes for different personas or verticals can help a lot.
4. **Product messaging guides**: core positioning and value props. Again, your website might already cover this, but Endgame will happily take deeper internal training or docs.
5. **Discovery and demo frameworks**: your proven questions and demo flow. A simple bulleted list of what needs to be covered works great.

### Don't overthink it

If your website clearly explains your methodology or competitive positioning, just point Endgame there. A simple one-pager beats nothing. And if you're missing something entirely, Endgame still works great with your connected data. Connecting your Knowledge just helps Endgame think more like your best reps.

On the flip side, if you have comprehensive enablement materials with detailed playbooks, extensive battlecards, and deep methodology documentation, Endgame can leverage all that richness too. There's no such thing as too much good content. Endgame will pull the relevant parts based on the questions being asked.

### Give Endgame what you want your team focused on

Most enablement teams already maintain current content and archive outdated materials. Endgame simply needs to look at the same content your reps use. No special effort or organization should be required.

The principle is straightforward: if you wouldn't want a new rep using it tomorrow, move it out of Endgame's view. The temptation to connect everything often leads to outdated content surfacing at the wrong moment. Better to have a small set of excellent, current materials than a vast library of mixed quality.
