## Introduction

In [Your First 10 Minutes](/your-first-10-minutes), you asked questions about a single account. But Endgame can also answer questions across your entire book of business or the entire organization.

That's what the homepage is for.

## How it works

From the [homepage](https://app.endgame.io/), you'll see the same chat interface as on account pages. The difference is that Endgame will search across all accounts you have access to, not just one.

Type your question and hit enter. Endgame will:

1. Identify which accounts are relevant to your question
2. Pull data from those accounts
3. Synthesize insights across them

## Tips for better book-level queries

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be specific about scope" icon="list-filter">
    "My accounts" vs "all accounts" vs "accounts closing this quarter" will give you different results. Say what you mean.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Set time boundaries" icon="calendar">
    "Last 30 days" or "this quarter" helps Endgame focus on relevant data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ask for rankings" icon="list-ordered">
    "Top 5" or "rank by priority" forces Endgame to synthesize rather than just list.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Request specific outputs" icon="table">
    "Put this in a table" or "give me bullet points" makes results easier to scan and act on.
  </Card>

## Working with results

Book-level queries often return tables with multiple accounts. Here's what you can do with them:

**Drill into an account:** Click any account name in the results to open that account's detail page and continue the conversation there.

**Export the data:** Hover over tables to copy as CSV, download, or export to Google Sheets.

**Save as a template:** If you find yourself running the same query weekly, [save it as a template](/features/templates) so you can rerun it with one click.

**Schedule it:** Use [Tasks](/features/tasks) to get book-level insights delivered to your inbox on a schedule.

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which accounts does Endgame search?">
    By default, Endgame searches accounts you have access to based on your Salesforce permissions and ownership. If you want to narrow or expand the scope, say so in your prompt (e.g., "across all enterprise accounts" or "just my named accounts").
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why is this slower than account-level queries?">
    Book-level queries search across more data. The more accounts involved, the longer it takes. You can speed things up by narrowing your scope or time range.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I save book-level queries?">
    Yes. Save them as templates from the [templates menu](/templates/create-manage-templates), or schedule them as Tasks to run automatically.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Where do I find my past book-level threads?">
    Click **Threads** in the left navigation to see all your non-account-specific conversations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
