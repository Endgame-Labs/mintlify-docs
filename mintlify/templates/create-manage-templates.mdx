  <Step title="Template customizations">
    - <b>Tags:</b> You are able to add tags to a template. Tags help users to categorize templates and filter them in order to select relevant templates more quickly. Create new tags, or select from existing tags. Templates are not required to have a tag, but can have multiple tags. We recommend not using more than two tags per template.
    - <b>Scope:</b> You can designate a "scope" for a template. Selecting "Account" indicates this template is most appropriate as a singlular account prompt, for example, "Build me a stakeholder map for this account". Alternatively you can select "Organization". This is most appropriate for a multiple account prompt, for example, "Summarize all of the important news and external events from the last week for my accounts."
