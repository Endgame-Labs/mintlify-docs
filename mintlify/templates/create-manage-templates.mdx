</Tip>

<div>As an admin you can create global templates that your entire team can access. You manage these global templates in the settings section of Endgame.</div>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access your templates in settings">
    Navigate to https://end-p1.endgame.io/settings/templates
    ![admin template](/mintlify/images/admin-templates-8-24-25.png)
  </Step>
 
  <Step title="Add, edit, delete">
    - Click "Add Template" (top right of the list) to add a new template
    - Click "Edit" next to any existing template to modify or delete it
      - You are able to add tags to a template. Tags help users to categorize templates and filter them in order to select relevant templates more quickly. Create new tags, or select from existing tags. Templates are not required to have a tag, but can have multiple tags. We recommend using 1-3 tags per template.
      - You can designate a "scope" for a template. Selecting Account threads only indicates this template is most appropriate as an account prompt, for example, "Build me a stakeholder map for this account". By unselecting this box, you designate this template as an organization template. This is most appropriate for a cross book prompt, for example, "Summarize all of the important news and external events from the last week for my accounts."
      - Delete a template by clicking Delete template in the lower left hand corner.

      <Info>
        Remember, any change you make to templates in settings such as creating, editing, or deleting templates applies to your entire organization.
