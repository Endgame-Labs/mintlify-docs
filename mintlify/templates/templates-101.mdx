Endgame unifies your sales data and makes it instantly accessible through AI-powered chat. But when every rep asks questions differently, you get different answersâ€”risking inconsistent execution when it matters most. Templates solve this by turning your best practices into repeatable, AI-enhanced workflows.

Think of templates as codifying your team's processes, similar to existing templates you may have in Notion or Slides. But now, instead of hoping reps remember to check seven different fields before a customer call, templates in Endgame ensure they get the complete picture every time. And because Endgame connects to Salesforce, Gong, Slack, and other critical systems, templates can automatically pull in the latest dataâ€”no manual copying required.

## Getting Started: Templates Can Be Simple

Here's the key insight: **a template can be as simple as a single, well-crafted prompt**. You don't need complex structures or detailed outlines to get started. Sometimes the most powerful template is just the right question, asked the right way.

### Simple Template Examples

**Pre-Call Research Brief**

```markdown expandable
Give me a comprehensive briefing for my upcoming call with [Company Name]. Include their recent business initiatives, key stakeholders I've engaged with, competitive landscape, and any risks or opportunities from our past interactions. Pull from Salesforce, Gong, and LinkedIn.
```

**Deal Inspection**

```markdown expandable
Analyze [Opportunity Name] and provide a comprehensive health check including: current stage vs. time in stage, engagement level of all stakeholders, completeness of MEDDIC criteria, recent activity from Gong and email, competitive threats, and red flags. Compare against similar won deals and highlight any gaps.
```

**Customer Health Check**

```markdown expandable
Analyze [Customer Name]'s health by reviewing: recent email and call patterns from our CRM, internal Slack discussions about this account, executive engagement level, external news or announcements about their company, and contract renewal date. Flag any concerning trends and suggest proactive outreach strategies.
```

Notice how these templates are just promptsâ€”but they're _consistent_ prompts that ensure everyone gets comprehensive, actionable information.

## Adding Structure: When Format Matters

While simple prompts work for many use cases, structured templates ensure consistency for important documents. Here's how to add just enough structure without overwhelming your team.

### Basic markdown structure

Use simple markdown to organize information:

```markdown expandable
Template: Quarterly Business Review Prep

# Q4 Business Review: [Customer Name]

## Executive Summary
Provide a 3-4 sentence summary of the customer's quarter including health status, key achievements, and any concerns.

## Sentiment and Progress
Show their feedback quotes, milestones achieved, and ROI achieved this quarter in a clear format.

## Relationship Status
- Executive Sponsor: [Name] - Last meeting: [Date]
- Champion: [Name] - Engagement level: [High/Medium/Low]
- Economic Buyer: [Name] - Sentiment: [Positive/Neutral/Negative]

## Recommendations
Based on the above analysis, what are 3-5 strategic recommendations for next quarter?
```

### Using Tables for Clarity

When comparing data or showing multiple items, tables help:

```markdown expandable
Template: Competitive Deal Analysis

# Competitive Analysis: [Opportunity Name] vs [Competitor]

## Feature Comparison
| Capability | Us | [Competitor] | Our Advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Integrations |  |  |  |
| Support |  |  |  |
| Security |  |  |  |

## Win Strategy
Based on similar competitive wins, focus on: [List key differentiators]
```

### Formatting Best Practices

**Keep It Simple**

- Use headers to create clear sections
- Bold important terms or metrics
- Use bullet points for lists
- Add line breaks for readability

**Be Consistent**

- If you use ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´ for status, use it everywhere
- Stick to one date format throughout
- Use the same header hierarchy across templates

**Design for Scanning**

- Put most critical info at the top
- Use short, clear section titles
- Include white space between sections
- Highlight calls-to-action

## When to Use Simple vs. Structured Templates

**Use simple prompt templates when:**

- The information needed varies significantly by situation
- You want flexibility in how data is presented
- Speed matters more than format consistency
- Teams are just getting started with templates

**Consider structured templates when:**

- You need consistent formatting for executive reviews
- Multiple people need to interpret the same information
- You're creating customer-facing deliverables
- Visual consistency improves comprehension and trust

## A framework for your templates

### Planning framework

![Template Framework Visual Sv](/mintlify/images/template-framework-visual.svg)

Before creating your first template, map out where templates can have the most impact. We recommend thinking along two dimensions:

**Sales process stage** (Horizontal Axis)

1. **Research & preparation**: Pre-call research, account planning, initial prospecting
2. **Active opportunity**: Discovery calls, proposal development, negotiation prep
3. **Post-sale & learning**: Implementation planning, QBRs, churn reviews, handoffs

**Audience** (Vertical Axis)

- **Internal**: team meetings, 1:1s between managers and reps
- **External**: business cases, emails, presentations for your customers

This framework helps you identify needs systematically. For example, if deals stall during negotiation, you might need an "Internal Negotiation Strategy" template (Active Opportunity \+ Internal).

### Minimalism: 5-10 templates might be all you need

Most successful teams need just 5-10 templates to transform their sales execution. More than that can become overwhelming and reduces adoption. Focus on templates that:

- Address your most frequent, time-consuming tasks
- Ensure consistency in critical customer interactions
- Capture institutional knowledge that typically lives in top performers' heads
- Support key moments in your sales process

### Real-world template opportunities

**Weekly rhythms**

- Monday morning review of critical action items
- Friday recaps of how the week went 
- Pre-pipeline review deal summaries

**Deal milestones**

- Post-discovery synthesis
- Stage-gate inspection reports (validating deal criteria)
- Business case development

**Quarterly Cadences**

- Beginning of quarter account planning briefs
- Quarterly business reviews with customers
- xxx

## Creating Your First Templates

### Your First 5 Templates: A Starter Pack

Based on dozens of customer implementations, these five templates deliver immediate impact:

   ```
2. **Call prep**

   ```
   Prepare me for my call with [Company Name]. Show their business context, recent interactions across all team members, open opportunities, support tickets, and suggested talking points based on their industry and our past successes.

## Best Practices for Template Success

### Writing Effective Templates

**Start with the End User**

- What decision are they trying to make?
- What information do they need to be successful?
- How can you save them time while improving quality?

**Be Specific but Flexible**

- Name the exact data points needed
- Reference your company's methodologies and Rules
- Allow for contextual variations

**Test with Real Scenarios**

- Run templates against 3-5 different accounts
- Check if outputs are actionable
- Verify data accuracy and completeness
- Time how long the manual alternative takes

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-Engineering from the Start**
   - Begin with simple prompts
   - Add structure only when needed
   - Let usage patterns guide evolution
2. **Creating Too Many Templates**
   - Stick to 5-10 high-impact templates
   - Resist the urge to template everything
   - Quality over quantity always wins
3. **Ignoring Feedback**
   - Force usage through meetings and rituals
   - Observe/ask for what's missing
   - Iterate based on actual needs
4. **Inconsistent Formatting**
   - Pick a style and stick to it
   - Use the same status indicators throughout
   - Keep section names consistent
