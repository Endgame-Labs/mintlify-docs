Endgame unifies your sales data and makes it instantly accessible through AI-powered chat. But when every rep asks questions differently, you get different answers—risking inconsistent execution when it matters most. Templates solve this by turning your best practices into repeatable, AI-enhanced workflows.

Think of templates as codifying your team's processes, similar to existing templates you may have in Notion or Salesforce. But now, instead of hoping reps remember to check seven different fields before a customer call, templates in Endgame ensure they get the complete picture every time. And because Endgame connects to Salesforce, Gong, Slack, and other critical systems, templates can automatically pull in the latest data—no manual copying required.

## Getting started: keep it simple

**A template can be as simple as a single, well-crafted prompt**. You don't need complex structures or detailed outlines to get started. Sometimes the most powerful template is just the right question, asked the right way.

### Two types of templates

**Single account templates** - For analyzing one account or opportunity at a time, such as:

- Pre-call research briefs
- Deal inspections
- QBR or renewal readiness

**Cross-account templates** - For analyzing patterns across multiple accounts, such as:

- Pipeline reviews
- Win/loss analysis
- Weekly recaps or preparation 

### Simple template examples

**Pre-call research brief** (single account)

```markdown expandable
Give me a comprehensive briefing for my upcoming call with [Company Name]. Include their recent business initiatives, key stakeholders I've engaged with, competitive landscape, and any risks or opportunities from our past interactions. Pull from Salesforce, Gong, and LinkedIn.
```

**Deal inspection** (single account)

```markdown expandable
Analyze [Opportunity Name] and provide a comprehensive health check including: current stage vs. time in stage, engagement level of all stakeholders, completeness of MEDDIC criteria, recent activity from Gong and email, competitive threats, and red flags. Compare against similar won deals and highlight any gaps.
```

**Customer health check** (single account)

```markdown expandable
Analyze [Customer Name]'s health by reviewing: recent email and call patterns from our CRM, internal Slack discussions about this account, executive engagement level, external news or announcements about their company, and contract renewal date. Flag any concerning trends and suggest proactive outreach strategies.
```

**Pipeline review** (cross-Account)

```
Analyze all my opportunities closing this month. For each deal, show: deal size, current stage, days in stage, last activity, key risks, and recommended next steps. Highlight which deals need immediate attention.
```

**Discovery quality check** (cross-Account)

```
Review all discovery calls from the past month and grade them on: pain identification, budget discussion, decision process mapping, and next steps clarity. Show me patterns of what our best discovery calls do differently.
```

Notice how these templates are just prompts—but they're consistent prompts that ensure everyone gets comprehensive, actionable information.

### When to use single vs. cross-account templates

**Use single account templates when:**

- Preparing for specific customer interactions
- Deep-diving on individual opportunities
- Creating customer-specific deliverables

**Use cross-account templates when:**

- Looking for patterns and trends
- Preparing for team meetings or reviews
- Identifying coaching opportunities
- Spotting systemic issues or best practices

### Add structure when format matters

While simple prompts work for many use cases, structured templates ensure consistency for important or more complex outputs.

**Basic markdown structure: headers and bullets**

Use simple markdown to organize information with headers and bullet lists:

```markdown expandable
Template: Quarterly Business Review Prep

# Q4 Business Review: [Customer Name]

## Executive Summary
Provide a 3-4 sentence summary of the customer's quarter including health status, key achievements, and any concerns.

## Sentiment and Progress
Show their feedback quotes, milestones achieved, and ROI achieved this quarter in a clear format.

## Relationship Status
- Executive Sponsor: [Name] - Last meeting: [Date]
- Champion: [Name] - Engagement level: [High/Medium/Low]
- Economic Buyer: [Name] - Sentiment: [Positive/Neutral/Negative]

## Recommendations
Based on the above analysis, what are 3-5 strategic recommendations for next quarter?
```

**Add tables for larger data sets**

When comparing data or showing multiple items, tables help:

```markdown expandable
Template: Competitive Deal Analysis

# Competitive Analysis: [Opportunity Name] vs [Competitor]

## Feature Comparison
| Capability | Us | [Competitor] | Our Advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Integrations |  |  |  |
| Support |  |  |  |
| Security |  |  |  |

## Win Strategy
Based on similar competitive wins, focus on: [List key differentiators]
```

### When to use simple vs. structured templates

**Use simple prompt templates when:**

- The information needed varies significantly by situation
- You want flexibility in how data is presented
- Speed matters more than format consistency
- Teams are just getting started with templates

**Consider structured templates when:**

- You need consistent formatting for executive reviews
- Multiple people need to interpret the same information
- You're creating customer-facing deliverables
- Visual consistency improves comprehension and trust

## Organizing with tags

Tags help teams find templates quickly. We've written more about tags [here](/templates/templates-102).

## Best practices for template success

### Writing effective templates

**Start with the end user**

- What decision are they trying to make?
- What information do they need to be successful?
- How can you save them time while improving quality?

**Be specific but flexible**

- Name the exact data points needed
- Reference your company's methodologies
- Allow for contextual variations

**Keep it simple**

- Use plain English instructions
- Avoid complex formatting unless necessary
- Focus on the information, not the structure

### Testing your templates

- Run each template against 3-5 different scenarios
- Check if outputs match your expectations and iterate
- Ask a handful of colleagues for feedback

### A note on personal templates

Individual users can now create their own templates for their personal workflow. While you'll focus on creating global templates for the team, encourage reps to experiment with personal templates for their unique needs—they might discover patterns worth scaling to the whole team.

## Conclusion: small changes, big impact

The best part about Endgame templates? You can start small and see immediate results. One well-crafted template that saves each rep 30 minutes per week adds up to massive productivity gains across your team.

Templates aren't about rigid processes or removing creativity from sales. They're about ensuring everyone has access to the same high-quality insights, so they can focus on what matters: building relationships and solving customer problems.

Start with one template tomorrow. Pick your biggest time waster or most common question. Write a simple prompt that gets your team the right information, every time. Add structure only where it truly helps. Then build from there.

The companies that win in the age of AI won't be those with the most complex systems, but those who can consistently turn their best practices into repeatable actions. Let templates be your first step on that journey.
