## Why tags matter

Tags make templates easier to find, not harder to manage. Without tags, templates become a long, unorganized list. With even just one simple tag category, your team can quickly filter to find exactly what they need.

If you're spending more than 5 minutes thinking about your tag strategy, you're overthinking it. After all, people can just search for the template they want as well.

## Start with one tag category

Most teams only need one way to organize templates. Pick the category that matches how your team thinks. A few examples:

### By stage

Tag templates by where they fit in your process:

- `prospect`
- `discovery`
- `active`
- `customer`
- `renewal`

Example: Your "Deal Inspection" template gets tagged `active`. Simple.

### By purpose

Tag templates by what they do:

- `prep`
- `analyze`
- `review`
- `report`
- `inspect`

Example: Your "Pre-call Research" template gets tagged `prep`.

### By scope

Tag templates by what they look at:

- `deal`
- `account`
- `pipeline`
- `territory`
- `team`

### By role

Tag templates by who will use them:

- `sdr` 
- `ae` 
- `csm` 
- `manager` 

Example: Your "Pipeline Review" template gets tagged `pipeline`.

## When to add a second category

Only add a second tag category if:

- You have 10\+ templates and finding them gets hard
- Your team naturally uses two dimensions to describe templates
- The combinations would genuinely help

For example, if you started with stages but now have 3-4 templates per stage, adding purpose tags could help:

- `discovery` \+ `prep` = Pre-discovery research
- `discovery` \+ `analyze` = Discovery call analysis

## Keep tags simple

### Do:

- Keep it short: `prep` not `preparation`
- Be consistent: if you use `qbr`, don't also use `quarterly`
- Use single words when possible
- Adjust tags later if needed

### Don't:

- Create ultra-specific tags
- Use more than 2 tags per template
- Overthink it

## Making it stick

1. Pick your approach (probably just one category)
2. Tag your existing templates consistently
3. Show the team how to filter by tags
4. Add complexity only if people ask for it

Remember: Start with one simple category. You can always add more later if needed - but you probably won't need to.
