### Planning framework

Now that you’ve created your first few templates to understand how they work, you may be tempted to create templates for everything you want the team to be doing or for every request coming from the team.

It can be easy to get overwhelmed with templates going down that path, so we’ve found it valuable to map out a light game plan for your templates to have the most impact. We recommend thinking along two dimensions:

![Template Framework Visual(3) Sv](/mintlify/images/template-framework-visual\(3\).svg)

**Sales process stage** (Horizontal Axis)

1. **Research & preparation**: Pre-call research, account planning, initial prospecting
2. **Active opportunity**: Discovery calls, proposal development, negotiation prep
3. **Post-sale & learning**: Implementation planning, QBRs, churn reviews, handoffs

**Audience** (Vertical Axis)

- **Internal**: team meetings, 1:1s between managers and reps
- **External**: business cases, emails, presentations for your customers

This framework helps you identify needs systematically. For example, if deals stall during negotiation, you might need an "Internal Negotiation Strategy" template (Active Opportunity \+ Internal).

### Minimalism: 5-10 templates might be all you need

Most successful teams need just 5-10 templates to transform their sales execution. More than that can become overwhelming and reduces adoption. Focus on templates that:

- Address your most frequent, time-consuming tasks
- Ensure consistency in critical customer interactions
- Capture institutional knowledge that typically lives in top performers' heads
- Support key moments in your sales process

One heuristic you can use to decide where to begin investing in templates is to think of the jobs to be done, internal rituals, and content generation the team does on a regular basis that is most painful or that needs the most improvement. 

In all cases, it is impotant to consider testing and getting feedback:

- Run each template you build against 3-5 different accounts
- Check if outputs are actionable
- Verify data accuracy and completeness
- Ask a handful of colleagues for feedback
