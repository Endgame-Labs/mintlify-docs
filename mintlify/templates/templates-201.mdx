## Why tags matter

Tags make templates easier to find, not harder to manage. Without tags, templates become a long, unorganized list. With just one simple tag category, your team can quickly filter to find exactly what they need.

If you're spending more than 5 minutes thinking about your tag strategy, you're overthinking it.

## Start with one tag category

Most teams only need one way to organize templates. Pick the category that matches how your team thinks:

### Option 1: By stage

Tag templates by where they fit in your process:

- `prospect`
- `discovery`
- `active`
- `customer`
- `renewal`

Example: Your "Deal Inspection" template gets tagged `active`. Simple.

### Option 2: By purpose

Tag templates by what they do:

- `prep`
- `analyze`
- `review`
- `report`
- `inspect`

Example: Your "Pre-call Research" template gets tagged `prep`.

### Option 3: By scope

Tag templates by what they look at:

- `deal`
- `account`
- `pipeline`
- `territory`
- `team`

Example: Your "Pipeline Review" template gets tagged `pipeline`.

## When to add a second category

Only add a second tag category if:

- You have 10\+ templates and finding them gets hard
- Your team naturally uses two dimensions to describe templates

For example, if you started with stages but now have 3-4 templates per stage, you might add purpose tags. Users could then filter by `discovery` to see all discovery templates, or by `prep` to see all prep templates across stages.

## Keep tags simple

### Do:

- Keep it short: `prep` not `preparation`
- Be consistent: if you use `qbr`, don't also use `quarterly`
- Use single words when possible
- Remember users can only filter by one tag at a time

### Don't:

- Create ultra-specific tags
- Add multiple tags thinking users can filter by combinations
- Overthink it

## Common patterns that work

**Stage only**: Tag by where templates fit in your process (`discovery`, `renewal`)

**Purpose only**: Tag by what templates do (`prep`, `analyze`, `review`)

**Role-based**: Tag by who uses them (`ae`, `csm`, `manager`) 

## Making it stick

1. Pick one approach
2. Tag existing templates consistently
3. Show the team how to filter
4. Remember: users can only filter by one tag at a time
