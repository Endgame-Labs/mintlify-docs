## When templates become workflows

Simple templates let Endgame choose the output format and level of detail. Advanced templates enforce consistency, ensuring every rep gets the same comprehensive analysis, formatted the same way, covering the same critical points.

- **Simple template:** a single question or request; output will vary by context
- **Advanced template**: structured briefing with clear sections, consistent detail level, and specific format (same output structure every time)

This consistency matters when you need:

- Managers reviewing multiple deal inspections
- Reps following a specific methodology
- Teams preparing for meetings the same way
- Leadership getting standardized reports

## Writing advanced templates

### Focus on narratives, not lists

Endgame excels at synthesis and analysis, not exhaustive enumeration.

**Less effective:**

```markdown expandable
List all opportunities closing this quarter with complete details
```

**More effective:**

```markdown expandable
Analyze my top 10 opportunities by deal size closing this month. For each, provide a brief narrative on deal health, key risks based on our methodology, and recommended next actions.
```

### Declarative over imperative

Tell Endgame what you want to know, not step-by-step instructions.

**Less effective:**

```markdown
1. First check Salesforce for the opportunity
2. Then look at Gong for calls
3. Next review emails
4. Finally compile a report
```

**More effective:**

```markdown
Provide a comprehensive deal analysis for this opportunity, including current status, stakeholder engagement patterns, competitive dynamics, and methodology gaps. Focus on what needs attention for this deal to progress.
```

### Structure for consistency

Advanced templates specify exact output structure:

```expandable
Analyze this opportunity with the following structure:

## Executive Summary
2-3 sentences on deal status and primary focus area

## MEDDIC Analysis
Table showing each criterion, current status, and gaps

## Stakeholder Engagement
Brief narrative on who's involved and who's missing

## Recommended Actions
Bullet points of specific next steps this week
```

### Additional best practices

- **Start with the decision.** Before writing a template, ask: "What decision will this enable?" Work backwards from there.
- **Optimize for scanning.** Use headers, bullets, and tables to make outputs easy to scan. Busy users need to find information quickly.
- **Keep scope focused.** Instead of "analyze everything," focus templates on specific aspects: deal health, competitive dynamics, or stakeholder engagement.
- **Test with real scenarios.** Run templates against 3-5 actual opportunities or accounts. Do the outputs drive clear action?

## Your next advanced template

1. **Identify a recurring decision** that takes significant time
2. **Map the information needed** to make that decision well
3. **Define the structure** that would make the output most useful
4. **Draft a template** that enforces that structure
5. **Test with real data** and refine based on output quality
6. **Share with the team** once you've validated value
