## Available Login Options

You can log into your account using either of these methods:

- **Salesforce** - Sign in with your existing Salesforce credentials
- **Google** - Sign in with your Google account

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

We do not currently offer direct SSO integration. However, if your organization has configured Salesforce to use SSO, you can still access SSO functionality by logging in through the Salesforce option. This will automatically route you through your organization's SSO system as configured within Salesforce.
