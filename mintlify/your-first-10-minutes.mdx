## Introduction

You've got access to Endgame. Now what?

This guide walks you through the same steps our team covers in live onboarding sessions. By the end, you'll have asked your first question, obtained a real insight, and learned how to get even better answers.

**Time needed:** 10-15 minutes

## Step 1: Set up your profile

_(2 minutes)_

Before you ask anything, help Endgame understand how to talk to you.

<Steps>
  <Step title="First time login">
    The first time you login, you'll be prompted to describe your role. If you skip it, you can click your initials in the bottom left corner, then click **Settings**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe your role">
    In the **Settings** \> **General** \> **Personalization** section, fill out the "Describe your role" field. Be specific about what you do day-to-day.

    **Examples:**

    - "I'm an Enterprise AE focused on new business in financial services. I manage 50 named accounts and need help with research, meeting prep, and deal strategy."
    - "I'm a CSM managing 30 mid-market accounts. I focus on renewals, expansion, and making sure customers are getting value."
    - "I'm a Sales Manager with 8 AEs. I need to stay on top of deals, coach my team, and prep for forecast calls."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add custom instructions (optional)">
    Tell Endgame how you prefer responses. For example:

    - "Be concise and use bullet points"
    - "Always include next steps I can act on"
    - "Avoid jargon and keep it simple"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a writing sample (optional)">
    If you want Endgame to draft emails that sound like you, paste an example of your writing style. This is especially useful for prospecting and follow-up emails.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  You can always update these settings later as you learn what works for you.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Pick an account you know 

_(1 minute)_

For your first question, pick an account you're already familiar with.

Click the Search button (or press `⌘K`) to find the account, then click into the account detail page.

<Note>
  **Your threads are private.** Only you can see your conversations unless you explicitly publish them. Experiment freely.
</Note>

---

## Step 3: Ask your first question 

_(3 minutes)_

Now for the fun part. Below are starter prompts based on your role. Pick one, paste it into the chat, and hit enter.

    **If you're prospecting into this account:**

    ```

    **If you have an active deal:**

    ```

    **For account overview:**

    ```
    I'm getting up to speed on this account. Give me the executive summary: deal status, key relationships, risks, and what I should know before talking to my rep about it.
    ```

    **For meeting prep:**

    ```
    I'm joining a customer call on this account. What context do I need? Include deal history, stakeholder map, and any sensitive topics I should be aware of.

## Step 4: Read the response 

_(2 minutes)_

Endgame will pull from your CRM, call recordings, emails, and public sources to answer your question. Here's how to get the most out of the response:

**Check the sources.** Click the **Sources** tab to see where the information came from. This helps you verify accuracy and dig deeper if needed.

**Look for surprises.** The most valuable insights are often things you didn't know or had forgotten. Pay attention to recent news, stakeholder changes, or themes from calls.

**Notice what's missing.** If Endgame doesn't mention something you expected, that's useful too. It might mean the information isn't in your systems, or you need to ask a more specific question.

---

## Step 5: Ask a follow-up 

_(2 minutes)_

The first answer is just the starting point. Now make it better.

**Go deeper on something specific:**

```
Tell me more about [topic from the response]. What exactly did they say about it?
```

**Get actionable:**

```
Based on this, what are the 3 things I should do this week?
```

**Challenge the response:**

```
Why did you say [X]? What evidence supports that?
```

**Change the format:**

```
Put the key points in a table with stakeholder, their priorities, and last interaction.
```

<Note>
  **Start fresh threads for different topics.** If you switch from account research to writing an email, start a new thread. Mixing topics in one thread can confuse the context.
</Note>

## Common early questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is Endgame showing different numbers than Salesforce?">
    This usually comes down to filtering. Endgame might be including or excluding records based on how you asked the question (e.g., "my accounts" vs "all accounts" or "open opportunities" vs "all opportunities").

    Try asking: _"Why did you include these accounts? What filters did you apply?"_

    Endgame will explain its reasoning, and you can adjust your question to get the view you want.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What data can Endgame actually see?">
    Endgame connects to your Salesforce, call recordings (Gong/Zoom/Chorus), emails, Slack (if connected), and public sources like LinkedIn and news. The specific fields depend on how your admin configured the integration.

    If you're not seeing something you expect, check with your admin about which Salesforce objects and fields are enabled.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can other people see my conversations?">
    No. Your threads are private by default. The only way someone else can see a thread is if you explicitly [Publish](https://docs.endgame.io/features/publishing-artifacts) it as an artifact. Even then, you can unpublish at any time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I'm not sure how to phrase my question?">
    Start simple and iterate. Ask something basic, see what you get, then refine. You can also ask Endgame directly: _"I'm trying to figure out X. What's the best way to ask you about that?"_
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if the answer is bad or inaccurate?">
    1. As a first step, ask Endgame about the discrepancy. This can help clarify the way the answer was provided.
    2. Then try to reframe the question based on the clarification.
    3. If the answer is still inaccurate, click the thumbs down icon at the bottom of the response and let us know why.
