# Tips and tricks

- **Ask follow up questions.** Think of the thread as a journey that allows you to continue exploration based on nuggets of insight that you see or areas you want to dig deeper into.
- **Start with the desired output in mind.** Knowing what you want as the final output greatly helps clarify your approach to questions, whether it’s a draft of a business case or a proposal, a quick meeting agenda, quote/insights from conversations to fill out a slide, or self-improvement feedback.
- **Use multiple perspectives.** Use different perspectives to evaluate from angles that you’re not used to as a way to uncover missing insights. For example, start a question with “as a VP sales” or “as the economic buyer” or as “the prospect’s CFO”.
- **Ask for feedback/grading.** Whether you’re reviewing a recent meeting, analyzing a deal, or building a proposal, asking AI to grade the object and suggest how it could be better can lead to many insights and ideas for strengthening deals and relationships.
- **Ask for quotes**. Asking for quotes (”include quotes”) is super helpful for capturing the language of the customer and focusing in on key topics with far more precision
- **Ask for options.** Unless you’re looking for a specific piece of information, there’s often not a single best answer for what you’re trying to do. Asking it for multiple options (”give me 3 options for how to…”) can yield a lot richer surface area from which to ideate and take action.
