# Getting Started

Getting started with Endgame is simple—and only requires that you authenticate via Salesforce:

1. Navigate to [https://end-p1.endgame.io/](https://end-p1.endgame.io/)
2. Click "Continue with Salesforce"
3. You'll be presented with two Salesforce API authentication screens—simply click "Allow" on both., at which point you'll be redirected back to Endgame
4. From there you can choose to authenticate [Gong](Gong%203cf042f6424d41d7ba236f5a6397113f.md) (assuming you're a technical admin) or [Zoom](Zoom%201a70ee6f29db802582b7dc368826abdd.md) (assuming you’re a Zoom administrator)

Once you have things connected, Endgame will automatically start ingesting your Salesforce data. This can take some time, and our team will reach out when it’s ready.
