# Templates

In Endgame, you can ask any question. Templated questions serve two specific purposes:

1. Ask a frequently asked question with the click of a button instead of having to type it out for every account every time
2. Generating the answer in a pre-determined, consistent format

Not only does using templates simplify the process of asking the same question across multiple accounts, but it also serves as a powerful mechanism to standardize processes and cultivate a shared understanding across the revenue org. A common example asking Endgame to generate an account plan, because your team likely has its own unique methods for formulating and presenting account plans for all of your accounts.

To use a template, navigate to any account and click the “Use Prompt Template” button in the lower left corner of the prompt text box.

You’ll then see a modal with a list of templates to choose from. Selecting one will fill out the prompt input text box with the template. All you have to do then is hit Enter to have Endgame start a new thread with the standardized response. At this time, you can also choose to directly make edits and tweaks to the prompt as desired.
