PR Description:
Fixes END-4262

## Summary
- Implemented rich text copy functionality that removes dark mode styling
- Ensures copied content works across different applications (Notion, Apple Notes, Google Docs)
- Maintains plain markdown format when pasting into code editors

## Changes Made
- Created `copy-utils.ts` with functions to convert markdown to clean HTML
- Updated `CopyMessage` component to use new rich text copy functionality
- Removed dependency on react-use's `useCopyToClipboard` hook

## Test Plan
- [ ] Copy a thread message with various formatting (headers, lists, code blocks)
- [ ] Paste into Notion - should appear as rich text without dark colors
- [ ] Paste into Apple Notes - should appear as rich text without dark colors
- [ ] Paste into Google Docs - should appear as rich text without dark colors
- [ ] Paste into VSCode/Cursor - should appear as plain markdown
- [x] Test fallback when clipboard API fails

## Implementation Details
The solution uses the Clipboard API to write both `text/plain` (markdown) and `text/html` (rich formatted) content. The HTML includes neutral styling that works universally across light and dark themed applications.

  Description: it's copying darkmode styling, but markdown format.

instead let's make it copy NO color in the styling;  but rich text format (mac and windows compatible, 

like when you copy rich content of Notion, Apple Notes, or Google Docs, you can paste it into any of the others and it's rich.  BUT if you paste into VSCode or Cursor, it's markdown.
